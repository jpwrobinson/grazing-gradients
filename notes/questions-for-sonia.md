**Bite volumes**. I can extract the mean size and bite rate area from Table S1 in your MEPS paper, then put that together to estimate bite volume, separately for small + large scrapers. However, it would be more powerful to use the gape sizes + TL of individual fishes that you use to produce the table. Are those data available?



**Bite rates**
