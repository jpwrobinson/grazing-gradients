## Hypothesis

Grazing functions (grazing, bioerosion, browsing) change predictably along gradient in habitat quality; these relationships are also disrupted by fishing and bleaching: 

* coral-dominated reefs characterised by high bioerosion rates and low browsing rates
* algal-dominated reefs characterised by high grazing + browsing rates
* Irrespective of habitat condition, protected and remote areas support higher natural levels of grazing + bioerosion.
* Above a given level of fishing pressure, bleaching events are followed by  increases in grazing + bioerosion rates

## Data required

* Size- and species-specific bite rates with corresponding function (bioerosion, turf removal, macroalgal removal)
* UVC herbivore biomass and corresponding benthic cover (coral, complexity, macroalgae, turf) along environmental + disturbance gradients
* Fishing pressure (biomass, market gravity), temperature, disturbance history, depth

## Possible data sources

* Function rates = David Bellwood, Andrew Hoey, Rebecca Fox, Pete Mumby papers
* CREP (Ivor Williams), Kenya & Seychelles (Tim McClanahan, Nick, Shaun), Chagos (Nick)



**Can we apply GBR feeding rates to WIO coral reefs?**

Confounding factors

* sedimentation (GBR work, Goatley)
* reef zone (Verges et al. 2011)
* fishing (selects parrotfish, so grazing isn't responding to habitat, Edwards et al. 2014)
* difficult to census browsers with UVC
* browsers target different MA groups (Streit et al. 2015)
* grazers may target detritus (Ctenochaetus) or algae (Acanthurid) (Bellwood, Mumby)
* grazing varies with temperature, productivity and wave energy (Bejarano, Bruno). Though we can probably account for seasonal effects, and measure temperature effects.
* predator biomass
* conspecifics. Higher grazing rates in groups (browsers, Michael et al. 2013)
