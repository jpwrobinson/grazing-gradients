#### Scraping patterns

**Scraping increases with richness and decreases with mean size**

**More species and/or lots of small fish increases the scraping function. This is overyielding?**

For this relationship to hold generally, some species *must* contribute disproportionately to scraping function. Function is a combination of bite rate, abundance, size, and commonness/rarity. 

Bite rates: highest in scarus

Biomass: 

Size: 

Some species scrape more when found in assemblages with higher species richness. Why?

Larger species tend to be rarer, have higher biomass, and a greater contribution to scraping function per site. The area scraped increases weakly with species size.  These patterns will be moderated by biomass - when rare species are present, are they also high biomass? Yes, but only if the species is large.

The excavator biomass (scrapers >35cm) doesn't change with species richness, and the scraped area doesn't change with excavator biomass.

**Small species tend to only occur in speciose communities, but have low contributions to scraping & biomass**. Important scraping species are large, common, and found in depauperate communities!

So rare species do not have disproportionate contribution to scraping, yet scraping is higher in speciose communities. This means that:

1. common scrapers scrape more in speciose communities (FALSE)
2. **speciose communities have higher biomass than depauperate ones** (**TRUE**)
3. richness effect on scraping is related to size (NO)
4. richness effect on scraping is related to abundance (YES)

**1. Individual species are not driving scraping increase.**  As species richness increases, individual species scrape more area (weak relationship) but have a lower overall scraping contribution (strong relationship). Some exceptions for rare species which increase their scraping contribution with species richness: 

* C. microrhinos (5 - 15%)
* H. flavipectoralis (2.5-5%)
* Scarus forsteni (0 - 2.5%)
* S. chameleon (0-10%)

3 species do increase their scraping contribution in high diversity assemblages: 

* S. tricolor (0.05 - 0.15, all regions)
* S. viridifucatus (0.09 - 0.18 m2, Chagos mainly)
* S. chameleon (0.05 - 0.15 m2, GBR only)

But removing these species has no effect on overall diversity result.



**3. Speciose communities have higher biomass/abundance**

Yes this is true, but only if you use log(biomass or abundance). So there is overyielding of function, but that is expected from positive function ~ biomass relationships.

Excavators are the largest scrapers, but the proportion of community biomass dominated by excavators does not change with species richness.



**4. Richness and size relationships vary among species**. Some species get bigger in more speciose communities (s. prasio., s. spinus, s. viridifucatus, s. falcipinnis), some species get smaller (c. bicolor, s. rivulatus, s. tricolor, s. schelgeli), and some do not change (s. ghobban, s. niger, s. sordidus). 

This is also true for scraping ~ size relationships: some species scrape more when they are small (presumably abundant?), some scrape more when they are large.



Size effects are because bite rates are far higher for smaller individuals. This pattern ignores the deeper scraping of larger-bodied parrotfish, which we have not measured.

Outliers - which sites are 2 standard deviations from their dataset means?

[5] "2014.Ste Anne Carbonate"             
[6] "2017.Mahe NW Carbonate" 

These sites tend to have large LFI (excavators), uneven assemblages, and moderately high biomass. Species richness is not particularly high (6-10), and mean size is comparable to most other reefs.
