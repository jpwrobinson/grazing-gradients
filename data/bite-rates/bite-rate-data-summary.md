#### Data from Sonia

22 species in cleaned dataset:

 [1] "cstriatus"    "zscopas"      "anigricans"   "scorallinus"  "csordidus"   
 [6] "schameleon"   "nlituratus"   "spuellus"     "soviceps"     "cmicrorhinos"
[11] "sniger"       "sschlegeli"   "sdimidiatus"  "squoyi"       "cbleekeri"   
[16] "svulpinus"    "anigrofuscus" "naso"         "sspinus"      "sforsteni"   
[21] "spsittacus"   "spunctatus"  

These are mostly scraper (scarid) and grazer (acanthurid), with 4 siganid species. Most observations are also scraper (241) and grazer (541), with only 5 siganids observed. Dominated by ctenochaetus striatus (n = 340) and chlorurus Sordidus (130), with all other species < 100 observations.

Survey times are very short, with median = 10 seconds and max = 60 seconds. Sonia pointed out that this is an inflated measure of grazing pressure, as it does not reflect inter-foray distances (i.e. pauses between grazing, movement between grazing areas).
