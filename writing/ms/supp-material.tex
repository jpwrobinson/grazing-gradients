\emph{Region details}

In Seychelles, 21 reefs were surveyed in 2008, 2014, and 2017 on two
inhabited islands (Mahe, Praslin). Surveys were conducted on the reef
slope at 9-12 m depth, and stratified to include carbonate fringing
reefs, granitic rocky reefs with coral growth, and patch reef habitats
on a sand, rubble, or rock base (Fig. S1B). Surveys were repeated for
either 8 (2008) or 16 (2011, 2014, 2017) replicates at each reef, which
were located at least 15 m away from each other. To ensure that survey
effort was comparable among Seychelles reefs, we only considered surveys
from the first 8 replicates (per site per survey year). Overall, the
surveys covered up to 0.5 km of reef front and 2,500
m\textsuperscript{2} of reef habitat, including 672 point counts over 4
surveyed years. Reefs were categorised by their exploitation status,
with 9 sites in small protected areas and 12 sites supporting artisanal
fisheries.

In the Chagos archipelago, 25 reefs were surveyed on four uninhabited
atolls in 2010 (Fig. S1B). Surveys were stratified to include sheltered
(9) and exposed (9) habitats, and four replicate transects were
conducted at each site, resulting in 100 total transects. All reefs were
categorised as remote.

In Maldives, 11 reefs were surveyed on one atoll (Huvadhoo) in 2013
(Fig. S1B). Surveys were conducted on the reef slope for 4 replicates
per reef, resulting in 44 total transects. All reefs were categorised as
fished.

In Australia, five reefs were surveyed on the central Great Barrier Reef
in 2010 and 2011 (Wheeler, Davies, Rib, Trunk, John Brewer) (Graham et
al.~2014) (Fig. S1B). Reefs were stratified to include 3 wave exposed
and 3 wave sheltered locations (6 per reef), which were further divided
into reef slope (7-9 m depth), reef crest (2-3 m depth), and reef flat
(100 m distance from crest). Each location and habitat type was surveyed
with four replicate transects. We used data for surveys conducted on the
reef slope, which produced a dataset of 24 transects per reef and 120
transects in total. Davies, Rib, Trunk and John Brewer were categorised
as fished, and Wheeler was categorised as protected (no-take zone).

\emph{Benthic categories}

Across all reefs, we detected four benthic regimes characterised by 1)
hard coral dominance, 2) macroalgal dominance, 3) high availability of
bare substrate, and 4) rubble reefs (Fig. S1B). Coral dominance was the
most common regime, detected at 41 reefs across all four regions,
whereas bare substrate regimes were only present in Seychelles (9) and
Chagos (6). Macroalgal dominance was detected on five Seychelles reefs
and nine GBR reefs, while rubble reefs were only present in Seychelles
(6 reefs).

by regimes identified in k-cluster analysis (rubble = yellow, macroalgae
