abstract = {Abstract The relative rates of carbon fixed by primary producers
vs. consumption by primary consumers shape the community of
organisms in ecosystems. On coral reefs, it is important to
understand the demography of algae, given known competitive
dynamics with reef-building corals. Numerous studies have shown
that fleshy algal abundance is enhanced in the absence of
top-down control by herbivores on coral reefs. However, fewer
studies have quantified and compared rates of production by the
benthic fleshy algal community and consumption by herbivores.
Here, we estimate a budget for fleshy algal growth and
herbivorous fish consumption on a Hawaiian coral reef based upon
integration of field-measured and taxonomically specific
variables. Data were collected at Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries
Management Area, Maui, established in 2009, in which taking of
herbivorous fish and urchins is prohibited. Daily algal
production was determined by quantifying benthic community
composition, standing stock of algal biomass, and growth rates of
common algal components. Consumption was determined using
distributions of biomass and size classes of herbivorous fish
species, consumption rates of herbivores on different algal
species, and herbivore bite sizes. Our results show that
throughout the first five years of herbivore protection, algal
production consistently exceeded the grazing capacity of the
herbivorous fish assemblage, but by a diminishing margin since
2010 (consumption 20.8{\%} of production) to the end of the study
in 2014 (consumption 67.0{\%} of production). Further, larger size
classes of herbivorous fishes in the scraper/excavator herbivore
guild contributed more to consumption in later years, which could
have additional feedbacks that promote reef-building taxa.
Projecting the budget using data from a neighboring decades-long
protected herbivorous fish assemblage indicated that the
production and consumption budget for Kahekili could become
balanced in future with continued management.},

observed feeding on macroalgae were related to spatial
dissimilarities in herbivore community composition. The total

8 in the Keppel Islands. Strong differences were also found in
the species composition and total biomass of nominally

anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural

also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a
tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore

substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences,

evaluation of ecological specialization in a coral reef fish

morphology and two realized niche axes associated with diet and
foraging microhabitat utilization using a recently developed
multidimensional framework. We then investigated the potential
relationships between morphological and behavioural
specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the
traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological
specialization showed no relationship with dietary
specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging
microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was
inverted: species with specialized morphologies were
microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were
microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors
relationships found in plant-pollinator communities and may also
be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential
importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization
into ecomorphological frameworks. On coral reefs, it appears
that morphotypes commonly perceived as most generalized may, in
fact, be specialized in exploiting flat and easily accessible

abstract = {Teleost fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates on
Earth. On tropical coral reefs, their species richness exceeds
6000 species; one tenth of total vertebrate biodiversity. A large
proportion of this diversity is composed of cryptobenthic reef
fishes (CRFs): bottom-dwelling, morphologically or behaviourally
cryptic species typically less than 50 mm in length. Yet, despite
their diversity and abundance, these fishes are both poorly
defined and understood. Herein we provide a new quantitative
definition and synthesise current knowledge on the diversity,
distribution and life history of CRFs. First, we use size
distributions within families to define 17 core CRF families as
characterised by the high prevalence ({\textgreater}10{\%}) of small-bodied
species ({\textless}50 mm). This stands in strong contrast to 42 families
of large reef fishes, in which virtually no small-bodied species
have evolved. We posit that small body size has allowed CRFs to
diversify at extremely high rates, primarily by allowing for fine
partitioning of microhabitats and facilitation of allopatric
reproductive isolation; yet, we are far from understanding and
documenting the biodiversity of CRFs. Using rates of description
since 1758, we predict that approximately 30 new species of
cryptobenthic species will be described per year until 2050
(approximately twice the annual rate compared to large fishes).
Furthermore, we predict that by the year 2031, more than half of
the described coral reef fish biodiversity will consist of CRFs.
These fishes are the 'hidden half' of vertebrate biodiversity on
coral reefs. Notably, global geographic coverage and spatial
resolution of quantitative data on CRF communities is uniformly
poor, which further emphasises the remarkable reservoir of
biodiversity that is yet to be discovered. Although small body
size may have enabled extensive diversification within CRF
families, small size also comes with a suite of ecological
challenges that affect fishes' capacities to feed, survive and
reproduce; we identify a range of life-history adaptations that
have enabled CRFs to overcome these limitations. In turn, these
adaptations bestow a unique socio-ecological role on CRFs, which
includes a key role in coral reef trophodynamics by cycling
trophic energy provided by microscopic prey to larger consumers.
Although small in body size, the ecology and evolutionary history
of CRFs may make them a critical component of coral-reef food
webs; yet our review also shows that these fishes are highly
susceptible to a variety of anthropogenic disturbances.
Understanding the consequences of these changes for CRFs and
coral reef ecosystems will require us to shed more light on this
frequently overlooked but highly diverse and abundant guild of
coral reef fishes.},

on coral reefs, yet its role in reef trophodynamics is poorly
understood. Evolutionary evidence suggests that reef flat
colonization by grazing fishes was a major innovation that
permitted the exploitation of new space and trophic resources.
However, the reef flat is hydrodynamically challenging, subject
to high predation risks and covered with sediments that inhibit
feeding by grazers. To explore these opposing influences, we
examine the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as a model system. We focus
on grazing herbivores that directly access algal primary
productivity in the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). By assessing
abundance, biomass, and potential fish productivity, we explore
the potential of the reef flat to support key ecosystem processes
and its ability to maintain fisheries yields. On the GBR, the
reef flat is, by far, the most important habitat for turf-grazing
fishes, supporting an estimated 79{\%} of individuals and 58{\%} of
the total biomass of grazing surgeonfishes, parrotfishes, and
rabbitfishes. Approximately 59{\%} of all (reef-wide) turf algal
productivity is removed by reef flat grazers. The flat also
supports approximately 75{\%} of all grazer biomass growth. Our
results highlight the evolutionary and ecological benefits of
occupying shallow-water habitats (permitting a ninefold
population increase). The acquisition of key locomotor and
feeding traits has enabled fishes to access the trophic benefits
of the reef flat, outweighing the costs imposed by water
movement, predation, and sediments. Benthic assemblages on reefs
in the future may increasingly resemble those seen on reef flats
today, with low coral cover, limited topographic complexity, and
extensive EAM. Reef flat grazing fishes may therefore play an
increasingly important role in key ecosystem processes and in

scales at community and macroecological levels. This study
evaluated the drivers of reef fish growth across a large gradient
of environmental variables and a range of morphological and
behavioural traits. We compiled Von Bertalanffy Growth parameters
for reef fishes and standardized K relative to species maximum
sizes, obtaining Kmax. We then modelled the response of Kmax to
body size, diet, body shape, position relative to the reef,
schooling behaviour, sea surface temperature, pelagic net primary
productivity and ageing method, while accounting for phylogenetic
structure in the data. The final model explained 61.5{\%} of the
variation in Kmax and contained size, temperature, diet, method
and position. Body size explained 64{\%} of the modelled Kmax
variability, while the other variables explained between 6{\%}
(temperature) and 2.5{\%} (position). Kmax steadily decreased with
body size and increased with temperature. All else being equal,
herbivores/macroalgivores and pelagic reef fishes had higher
growth rates than the other groups. Moreover, length?frequency
ageing tended to overestimate Kmax compared to other methods
(e.g. otolith's rings). Our results are consistent with (a)
metabolic theory that predicts body size and temperature
dependence of physiological rates; and (b) ecological theory that
implies influence of resource availability and acquisition on
growth. At last, we use machine learning to accurately predict

abstract = {Coral reefs provide a number of ecosystem services including
coastal defense from storms, the generation of building
materials, and fisheries. It is increasingly clear that the
management of reef resources requires an ecosystem approach in
which extractive activities are weighed against the needs of the
ecosystem and its functions rather than solely those of the
fishery. Here, I use a spatially explicit simulation model of a
Caribbean coral reef to examine the ecosystem requirements for
grazing which is primarily conducted by parrotfishes (Scaridae).
The model allows the impact of fishing grazers to be assessed in
the wider context of other ecosystem processes including
coral-algal competition, hurricanes, and mass extinction of the
herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum. Using a new analytical
model of scarid grazing, it is estimated that parrotfishes can
only maintain between 10{\%} and 30{\%} of a structurally complex
forereef in a grazed state. Predictions from this grazing model
were then incorporated into a broader simulation model of the
ecosystem. Simulations predict that scarid grazing is unable to
maintain high levels of coral cover ({\textgreater} or = 30{\%}) when severe
hurricanes occur on a decadal basis, such as occurs in parts of
the northern Caribbean. However, reefs can withstand such intense
disturbance when grazing is undertaken by both scarids and the
urchin Diadema. Scarid grazing is predicted to allow recovery
from hurricanes when their incidence falls to 20 years or less
(e.g., most of Central and South America). Sensitivity analyses
revealed that scarid grazing had the most acute impact on model
behavior, and depletion led to the emergence of a stable,
algal-dominated community state. Under conditions of heavy grazer
depletion, coral cover was predicted to decline rapidly from an
initial level of 30{\%} to less than 1{\%} within 40 years, even when
hurricane frequency was low at 60 years. Depleted grazers caused
a population bottleneck in juvenile corals in which algal
overgrowth caused elevated levels of postsettlement mortality and
resulted in a bimodal distribution of coral sizes. Several new
hypotheses were generated including a region-wide change in the
spatial heterogeneity of coral reefs following extinction of
Diadema. The management of parrotfishes on Caribbean reefs is
usually approached implicitly through no-take marine reserves.
The model predicts that depletion of grazers in nonreserve areas
can severely limit coral accretion. Other studies have shown that
low coral accretion can reduce the structural complexity and
therefore quality of the reef habitat for many organisms. A
speculative yet rational inference from the model is that failure
to manage scarid populations outside reserves will have a
profoundly negative impact on the functioning of the reserve
system and status of non-reserve reefs.},

dramatic explosion of macroalgae, which suppressed the
fecundity, recruitment, and survival of corals. Consequently,
management of fish stocks is a key component in preventing phase
shifts and managing reef resilience. Importantly, local

abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most highly productive marine
ecosystems, with a strong connection between herbivores and the
production of benthic algae. The epilithic algal matrix (EAM) is
a major source of primary production on coral reefs, and it is
one of the dominant benthic microhabitats, covering up to 80{\%} of
reef flats and back reefs and up to 70{\%} of reef slopes on
outer-shelf sites of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Although
herbivorous surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) are dominant members of
most reef fish assemblages, there is a lack of quantitative
information on their grazing impact, particularly those that feed
upon the EAM in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to investigate the role of surgeonfish in maintaining
algal turf biomass on coral reefs. Spatial patterns of EAM
productivity, and herbivorous fish biomass and grazing intensity
were quantified at different depths (deep vs. shallow) and
exposures (windward vs. leeward) of reef slope environments of
Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef. Surgeonfish were the
numerically-dominant EAM grazing fish family, and to identify the
daily impact of surgeonfish species on the EAM, data on their
biomass (gm−2) and grazing intensity (total bitesm−2day−1) were
combined with EAM productivity estimates (gCm−2day−1). EAM
productivity was greatest in windward and shallow sites, and
herbivorous fish biomass mirrored this pattern. Yet, there was no
difference in the EAM standing crop or grazing intensity among
habitats. In the most productive habitat (windward-shallow),
grazer/detritivore surgeonfish species accounted for 74{\%} of the
total herbivore biomass (gm−2), took 51{\%} of the total bites
(m−2day−1), and removed an estimated 73{\%} of daily EAM
productivity (gCm−2day−1). This study quantifies the role of
surgeonfish in maintaining EAM biomass, and highlights their
possible contribution to preventing shifts from coral- to
algal-dominance following disturbance.},

Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes) were responsible for over 80 per

competition by evolving morphological or behavioural
specialisations that allow them to spread out along resource axes
such as space, diet and temporal activity. These specialisations
define how a species interacts with its environment and, by
extension, determine its functional role. Here, we examine the
feeding niche of three species of coral reef-dwelling
rabbitfishes (Siganidae, Siganus). By comparing aspects of their
feeding behaviour (bite location, bite rate, foraging distance)
with that of representative species from two other abundant
herbivorous fish families, the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarus)
and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Acanthurus), we examine whether
rabbitfishes have a feeding niche distinct from other members of
the herbivore guild. Measurements of the penetration of the
fishes' snouts and bodies into reef concavities when feeding
revealed that rabbitfish fed to a greater degree from reef
crevices and interstices than other herbivores. There was just a
40 {\%} overlap in the penetration-depth niche between rabbitfish
and surgeonfish and a 45 {\%} overlap between rabbitfish and
parrotfish, compared with the almost complete niche overlap (95
{\%}) recorded for parrotfish and surgeonfish along this spatial
niche axis. Aspects of the morphology of rabbitfish which may
contribute to this niche segregation include a comparatively
longer, narrower snout and narrower head. Our results suggest
that sympatric coexistence of rabbitfish and other reef
herbivores is facilitated by segregation along a spatial (and
potentially dietary) axis. This segregation results in a unique
functional role for rabbitfishes among roving herbivores that of
``crevice-browser'': a group that specifically feeds on
crevice-dwelling algal or benthic organisms. This functional
trait may have implications for reef ecosystem processes in terms
of controlling the successional development of crevice-based

lasting at least six decades. Specifically, to what extent are C.

address this question, we used natural feeding surfaces, covered
with late successional stage reef-grown algal turfs, to examine
turf algal removal by the two species. Surfaces exposed to C.

reductions in turf length or area covered by turfing algae. In
marked contrast, A. nigrofuscus reduced turf length by 51{\%} and
area covered by turfing algae by 15{\%} in 1 h. The gut contents of

predominantly ingests algae (the dominant item in 79.6–94.7{\%} of
gut content quadrats), while C. striatus ingests detritus and
sediments (dominant in 99.6–100{\%} of quadrats). Therefore, C.
striatus ingests detritus and sediment, leaving mature algal
turfs relatively intact, while A. nigrofuscus directly removes

reefs, and there is a clear need to understand the role and

While numerous studies have quantified the roles of parrotfishes
and surgeonfishes on coral reefs, the rabbitfishes (f. Siganidae)
have been largely overlooked. Consequently, they are typically
viewed as a uniform group of grazing or browsing fishes. Here, we
quantify the diet and distribution of rabbitfish assemblages on
six reefs spanning the continental shelf in the northern Great
Barrier Reef. Our results revealed marked variation in the diet
and distribution of rabbitfish species. Analysis of stomach
contents identified four distinct groups: browsers of leathery
brown macroalgae (Siganus canaliculatus, S. javus), croppers of
red and green macroalgae (S. argenteus, S. corallinus, S.
doliatus, S. spinus) and mixed feeders of diverse algal material,
cyanobacteria, detritus and sediment (S. lineatus, S.
punctatissimus, S. punctatus, S. vulpinus). Surprisingly, the
diet of the fourth group (S. puellus) contained very little algal
material (22.5 {\%}) and was instead dominated by sponges (69.1
{\%}). Together with this variation in diet, the distribution of
rabbitfishes displayed clear cross-shelf variation. Biomass was
greatest on inner-shelf reefs (112.7  18.2 kg.ha−1),
decreasing markedly on mid- (37.8  4.6 kg.ha−1) and
outer-shelf reefs (9.7  2.2 kg.ha−1). This pattern was
largely driven by the browsing S. canaliculatus that accounted
for 50 {\%} of the biomass on inner-shelf reefs, but was absent in
mid- and outer-shelf reefs. Mixed feeders, although primarily
restricted to the reef slope and back reef habitats, also
decreased in abundance and biomass from inshore to offshore,
while algal cropping taxa were the dominant group on mid-shelf
reefs. These results clearly demonstrate the extent to which diet
and distribution vary within the Siganidae and emphasise the
importance of examining function on a species-by-species basis.},

group on coral reefs due to their role in preventing phase
shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance, and potentially
reversing the shift should it occur. However, assessments of
macroalgal herbivory using bioassay experiments are primarily
from systems with relatively high coral cover. This raises the
question of whether continued functionality can be ensured in
degraded systems. It is clearly important to determine whether
the species that remove macroalgae on coral-dominated reefs will
still be present and performing significant algal removal on
macroalgal-dominated reefs. We compared the identity and
effectiveness of macroalgal-feeding fishes on reefs in two
conditions post-disturbance—those regenerating with high live
coral cover (20–46 {\%}) and those degrading with high macroalgal
cover (57–82 {\%}). Using filmed Sargassum bioassays, we found
significantly different Sargassum biomass loss between the two
conditions; mean assay weight loss due to herbivory was 27.9
 4.9 {\%} on coral-dominated reefs and 2.2  1.1 {\%} on
reefs with high macroalgal cover. However, once standardised for
the availability of macroalgae on the reefs, the rates of
removal were similar between the two reef conditions (4.8 
4.1 g m−2 h−1 on coral-dominated and 5.3  2.1 g m−2 h−1 on
macroalgal-dominated reefs). Interestingly, the Sargassum-assay
consumer assemblages differed between reef conditions; nominally
grazing herbivores, Siganus puelloides and Chlorurus sordidus,
and the browser, Siganus sutor, dominated feeding on high coral
cover reefs, whereas browsing herbivores, Naso elegans, Naso
unicornis, and Leptoscarus vaigiensis, prevailed on
macroalgal-dominated reefs. It appeared that macroalgal density
in the surrounding habitat had a strong influence on the species
driving the process of macroalgal removal. This suggests that
although the function of macroalgal removal may continue, the
species responsible may change with context, differing between
systems that are regenerating versus degrading.},

investigated the spatial variation in benthic communities on
fringing reefs around the inner Seychelles islands. Specifically,
relationships between benthic composition and the underlying

high structural complexity to high macroalgae cover (up to 95{\%})

associated with declining species richness of fishes, reduced
diversity of fish functional groups, and lower abundance of
corallivorous fishes. There were no reciprocal increases in
herbivorous fish abundances, and relationships with other fish
functional groups and total fish abundance were weak. Reefs
grouping at the extremes of complex coral habitats or

with an exploratory analysis of empirical relationships among
potential drivers and state variables. While relationships among
herbivory, algal cover, and coral recruitment, have been
explored in the Caribbean, the nature of such relationships in
the Pacific appears to be variable or unclear. Here, we examine
potential drivers structuring the benthos and herbivorous fish
assemblages of outer-shelf reefs in Micronesia (Palau, Guam and
Pohnpei). Surveys were stratified by wave exposure and
protection from fishing. High biomass of most herbivores was
favoured by high wave exposure. High abundance of large-bodied
scarids was associated with low turf abundance, high coral
cover, and marine reserves. The remaining herbivores were more
abundant in reefs with low coral cover, possibly because space
and hence food limitation occur in high-coral-cover reefs.
Rugosity had no detectable effect on herbivorous fish abundance
once differences in exposure and coral cover were accounted for.
At identical depths, high wave exposure was associated with
greater volumes (cover  canopy height) of macroalgae and
algal turfs, which most likely resulted from high primary
productivity driven by flow. In exposed areas, macroalgal cover
declined as the acanthurid biomass increased. The volume of
algal turfs was negatively associated with coral cover and
herbivore biomass. In turn, high coral cover and herbivore
biomass are likely to intensify grazing. The density of juvenile
corals was variable where macroalgal cover was low but was
confined to lower densities where macroalgal cover was high.
High coral cover and density of juvenile corals were favoured in
sheltered habitats. While a weak positive relationship was found
between scarid biomass and juvenile coral density, we
hypothesise that high scarid densities may hinder juvenile
density through increased corallivory. New hypotheses emerged
that will help clarify the role of acanthurids, wave exposure,

influencing community assembly, the extent to which these modify
species functions, and entire ecosystem processes, is poorly
understood. Focusing on a high-diversity system, we ask whether
environmental filtering has ecosystem-wide effects beyond
community assembly. We characterise a coral reef herbivorous fish
community for swimming performance based on ten functional traits
derived from fish morphology. We then investigate whether wave
exposure modifies the functional make-up of herbivory, and the
absolute and relative feeding frequency of distinct feeding
functional groups. Herbivorous fish species conformed to either
laterally compressed or fusiform body plans, which differ in
their morphological design to minimise drag. High wave exposure
selectively limited the feeding function of the deepest body
shapes with highest caudal thrust efficiency, and favoured
fusiform bodies irrespective of pectoral fin shape. Traditionally
recognised herbivore feeding functional groups (i.e.
grazers?detritivores and scrapers?small excavators) differed in
swimming performance, and in their capacity to feed consistently
across levels of wave exposure. We therefore emphasise the
distinctness of their ecological niche and functional
complementarity. Species within the same feeding functional group
also had contrasting responses to wave exposure. We thereby
reveal a further ecological dimension of niche partitioning, and
reiterate the risk of assuming functional redundancy among
species with a common feeding mode. Contrasting responses of
species within feeding functional roles (i.e. response diversity)
allowed the preservation of critical trophic functions throughout
the gradient (e.g. macroalgal browsing), and likely explained why
overall levels of herbivory were robust to filtering. Whether
ecosystem functioning will remain robust under the additive
effects of environmental stress and human-induced disturbances
remains to be tested. A lay summary is available for this

movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in
schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this
study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling
S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert
their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of
the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their
ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were
monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic
array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In
addition, behavioural observations recorded school
size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus
inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S.
rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential
home range of individuals was 24,440 m2 and ranges overlapped
extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School
size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7
individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the
functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools
being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times
higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that,
despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a
limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef,

abstract = {Patterns in the commonness and rarity of species are a
fundamental characteristic of ecological assemblages; however,
testing between alternative models for such patterns remains an
important challenge. Conventional approaches to fitting or
testing species abundance models often assume that species, not
individuals, are the units that are sampled and that species'
abundances are independent of one another. Here we test three
different models (the Poisson lognormal, the negative binomial,
and the neutral, ``zero-sum multinomial'' [ZSM]) against species
abundance distributions of Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes.
We derive and apply several alternative bootstrap analyses of
model fit, each of which makes different assumptions about how
species abundance data are sampled, and we assess the extent to
which tests of model fit are sensitive to such assumptions. For
all models, goodness of fit is remarkably consistent, regardless
of whether one assumes that species or individuals are the units
that are sampled or whether or not one assumes that species'
abundances are statistically independent of one another.
However, goodness-of-fit estimates are approximately twice as
precise and detect lack of model fit more frequently, when based
on sampling of individuals, rather than species. Bootstrap
analyses indicate that the Poisson lognormal distribution
exhibits substantially better fit to species abundance patterns,
consistent with model selection analyses. In particular,
heterogeneity in species abundances (many rare and few highly
abundant species) is too great to be captured by the ZSM model
or the negative binomial model and is best explained by models
that predict species abundance patterns that are much closer,
but not identical, to the lognormal distribution. More broadly,
our bootstrap analyses suggest that estimates of model fit are
likely to be robust to assumptions about the statistical
interdependence of species abundances, but that tests of model
fit are more powerful when they assume sampling of individuals,
rather than species. Such individual-based tests therefore may
be able to identify lack of model fit where previous tests have
been inconclusive.},

abstract = {Summary Functional redundancy contributes to resilience if
different species in the same functional group respond to
disturbance in different ways (response diversity). If species
in a functional group perform their functional role at different
spatial scales (cross-scale redundancy), they are expected to
respond differently to scale-specific disturbance. Consequently,
variance in the spatial scales over which species perform their
functional role may provide a proxy for resilience. Coral reefs
are diverse systems that provide key ecosystem services and are
subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Algal grazing
by herbivorous fish contributes to the maintenance of
coral-dominated reefs. To date, there has been little evaluation
of the traits driving response diversity among herbivorous fish
and how this relates to coral recovery following acute
disturbances. Using body size as a proxy for the spatial scale
at which fish function, we tested whether cross-scale redundancy
in herbivores was an effective indicator of response diversity
and coral recovery on 21 reefs monitored through a
climate-induced disturbance that caused coral bleaching and
widespread coral mortality. When herbivorous fish assemblages
that operated over a broader range of spatial scales were
present on reefs prior to disturbance, the reefs were more
likely to recover to coral-dominated states after the
disturbance. After the temperature-induced disturbance, the loss
of small herbivores was compensated for through increases in
large herbivores. This was indicative of high response diversity
and drove the overall increase in herbivore biomass at
recovering sites. These compensatory mechanisms were not found
at sites where herbivores operated over a narrower range of
spatial scales. Synthesis and applications. Cross-scale
redundancy provides managers with an indicator of coral reef
resilience, although the contribution of cross-scale redundancy
to resilience will vary among sites. Maintaining high
cross-scale redundancy at a given site requires that no size
classes of reef herbivores are disproportionately depleted by
fishing. Balanced harvesting, where species are all fished in
proportion to their potential production, would help achieve
this.},

maintenance of ecosystems within desired states. However, there
are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of interspecific
differences in the functional roles of organisms, particularly
with regard to the spatial scales over which functional impact
is exerted. This has implications for the delivery of function
and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. In this study we
assessed the allometric relationship between foraging movements
and fish body length at three sites, for 20 species of
herbivorous reef fishes within four different functional groups:
browsers, farmers, grazer/ detritivores, and scraper/excavators.
The relationship between vulnerability of species to fishing and
their scale of foraging was also examined. We present empirical
evidence of the strong, positive, log-linear relationship
between the scale of foraging movement and fish body length.
This relationship was consistent among sites and between the two
different movement metrics used. Phylogeny did not affect these
results. Functional groups foraged over contrasting ranges of
spatial scales; for example, scraper/excavators performed their
role over a wide range of scales, whereas browsers were
represented by few species and operated over a narrow range of
scales. Overfishing is likely not only to remove species
operating at large scales, but also to remove the browser group
as a whole. Large fishes typically have a significant role in
removing algae on reefs, and browsers are key to controlling
macroalgae and reversing shifts to macroalgal-dominated states.
This vulnerability to exploitation has serious consequences for
the ability of fish assemblages to deliver their functional role
in the face of anthropogenic impacts. However, identification of
the scales at which herbivorous fish assemblages are susceptible

management strategies to support coral-dominated reefs by
maintaining function at the spatial scales at which vulnerable

functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with

termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most
speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out

insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR
is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever
the richness, over a third of the species may still be in
overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are
left without insurance, these levels all being significantly

potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and

characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the
potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability

grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining
the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a
key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial
dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of
these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of
herbivory on reefs are not well understood. * Here, we present a
novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of
marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of
remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12 months, we tracked
the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species
of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community. *
Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we
found that individual fishes clustered their activities within
small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and
movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along
predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on
particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring

vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing

likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of

highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of
herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of

preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The

scraping a greater substratum area per unit biomass and larger
individuals taking a greater volume of material per unit
biomass. Thus, biomass cannot be not be viewed as a proxy for
ecosystem impact; different sized individuals of S. rivulatus,

morphological traits of the browsing fishes and how this may
influence the removal of macroalgal material. Using video
observations of fish feeding on the brown macroalga Sargassum

Siganus doliatus). The greatest distinction between species was
the algal material they targeted. K. vaigiensis and N. unicornis
bit on the entire macroalgal thallus in approximately 90 {\%} of
bites. In contrast, Si. canaliculatus and Si. doliatus avoided
biting the stalks, with 80–98 {\%} of bites being on the

thallus-biters' versus `leaf-biters' was not supported by
size-standardized measures of biting morphology. Rather,
species-specific adult body sizes, tooth shape, and feeding

adults of the two larger fish species (N. unicornis and K.

smaller species (Si. canaliculatus and Si. doliatus) bite only
leaves. These findings caution against assumed homogeneity

is limited, the smaller `leaf-biting' species are unlikely to be

fishes (slopes of 1.15-1.72), with predators having larger home

mobility and lower abundance of predators' food items. Coral
reef fishes, and fishes in general, appear to occupy a smaller
area per unit mass than terrestrial vertebrates (intercepts of
-0.92 to 0.07 versus 1.14). This is likely linked to the
relative metabolic costs of moving through water compared to
air. The small home ranges of reef fishes and their apparent
reluctance to cross open areas suggest that reserves aimed at
protecting fish species may be more effective if located across
whole reefs, even if those reefs are comparatively small, rather

Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and
in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous
fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low.
Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing
on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime

species-rich vertebrate assemblage in which to test these
generic responses. Here we examined these relationships by

Although lifetime reproductive output was low, consistent with
their small body sizes, short generation times of 47-74 days
help overcome low individual fecundity and appear to be a
critical feature in maintaining Eviota populations. Comparisons

abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and
species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare
species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of
species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has
been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains
controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure
against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This
issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where
high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it
is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered
against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species
occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse
ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662
tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct
combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare
species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy.
Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are
likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other
species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than
expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63{\%}
and 98{\%} of fish species that are likely to support highly
vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and
regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32{\%} and 89{\%}
of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively.
Remarkably, 47{\%} of fish species and 55{\%} of tropical tree
species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions
have only one individual per sample on average. Our results
emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in
highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high
functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic,
cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately
increase the potential breadth of functions provided by
ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to
insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change
and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems.
Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role
of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {State indicators, e.g., mean size and trophic level of the fish assemblage, can provide important insights into the effects of fishing on ecosystems and the resource potential of the fishery. On coral reefs, few studies have examined the relative effects of fishing and other drivers, such as habitat, on these indicators. In light of habitat heterogeneity and increasing habitat degradation, this lack of understanding limits the usefulness of indicators for monitoring the effect of fishery management actions. Identifying thresholds or nonlinearities in relationships between fishing pressure and state indicators has been suggested as a basis for biomass-based targets to support management efforts in low research capacity contexts. Using data collected in Seychelles, we examined the relative influences of fishable biomass (proxy for fishing pressure) and the benthic habitat on fisheries-independent indicators characterizing attributes of the fish community important for fisheries production. We characterized the driver–indicator relationships, and compared local-scale relationships for Seychelles with large-scale relationships published for the Indian Ocean. We found that both habitat and fishing pressure influenced indicators, but habitat effects were particularly strong. This knowledge provides managers with the capacity to implement a diverse array of complementary management actions targeting these drivers. A number of the Seychelles scale driver–indicator relationships were linear, suggesting gradual changes in indicators in response to changes to drivers. This contrasted with relationships published for the Indian Ocean, which were characterized by thresholds below which exploitation is likely to have significant detrimental effects on the functioning of important ecosystem processes. These scale-specific differences are likely driven by the narrower range of fishing pressures found in Seychelles. Importantly, it indicates that, although biomass-based targets derived from large-scale relationships may provide a useful starting point for setting management targets, the local context must be considered.},

Three successively weakening interaction tiers separate management of fishing from coral abundance. We studied 12 islands along the 700-km eastern Caribbean archipelago, comparing fished and unfished coral reefs. Fishing reduced biomass of carnivorous (snappers and groupers) and herbivorous (parrotfish and surgeonfish) fishes. We document attenuating but important effects of managing fishing, which explained 37{\%} of variance in parrotfish abundance, 20{\%} of variance in harmful algal abundance, and 17{\%} of variance in juvenile coral abundance. The explained variance increased when we quantified herbivory using area-specific bite rates. Local fisheries management resulted in a 62{\%} increase in the archipelago's juvenile coral density, improving the ecosystem's recovery potential from major disturbances.},

We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment.

The osteology and myology of the jaws of all 24 species were examined, and a detailed description of a representative species from each group is provided . The relative weights of the major jaw structures of five representative species were quantified . Morphological differences between species were interpreted in a functional context and were assessed based on observations of feeding in the field . Species in the two functional groups show major group-related differences in their bite speeds, microhabitat utilization pat-terns, and form and extent of substratum excavation during grazing . Group-related differences are also apparent in feeding rates, foray sizes and bite rates . The division of the species into two functional groups is supported by both morphological and behavioural observations . The ecological significance of two function-al groups within the family is discussed in relation to the role of parrotfishes on reefs, particularly in terms of bioerosion.},

abstract = {Reduced herbivory and enhanced nutrient concentrations have both been suggested as probable mechanisms driving phase shifts from coral to algal dominance on tropical reefs. While there is considerable information regarding the eects of herbivores on reefs, there is little experimental evidence of nutrient eects or the interactive eects of both of these factors. This study experimentally tested the role of these factors on benthic community structure on a coral-dominated reef in Hawaii. A randomized factorial block design was used to simultaneously investigate the eects of nutrient enrichment and herbivore exclusion on the development of benthic algal communities on arti{\textregistered}cial surfaces over a 6-month time period. Total algal biomass was greatest on settlement surfaces exposed to both nutrient en-richment and herbivore exclusion simultaneously. Fle-shy algal biomass was greatest on surfaces removed from grazing whereas calcareous biomass was greatest on surfaces exposed to nutrient enrichment. Control surfaces exhibited consistently less total, ¯eshy and calcareous algal biomass than that on any of the experimental surfaces. Microinvertebrates were most abundant on surfaces within herbivore exclusion treat-ments but increased in number on all settlement sur-faces over time. Sediment accumulation was positively correlated with ¯eshy algal biomass and was most abundant on surfaces within herbivore exclusion treat-ments; there was no pattern in sediment accumulation over time. This research demonstrates that on short time scales (less than 6 months), nutrient enrichment and herbivore exclusion can independently and inter-actively support shifts in benthic algal community structure on a Hawaiian reef.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most highly productive marine ecosystems, with a strong connection between herbivores and the production of benthic algae. The epilithic algal matrix (EAM) is a major source of primary production on coral reefs, and it is one of the dominant benthic microhabitats, covering up to 80{\%} of reef flats and back reefs and up to 70{\%} of reef slopes on outer-shelf sites of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Although herbivorous surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) are dominant members of most reef fish assemblages, there is a lack of quantitative information on their grazing impact, particularly those that feed upon the EAM in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of surgeonfish in maintaining algal turf biomass on coral reefs. Spatial patterns of EAM productivity, and herbivorous fish biomass and grazing intensity were quantified at different depths (deep vs. shallow) and exposures (windward vs. leeward) of reef slope environments of Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef. Surgeonfish were the numerically-dominant EAM grazing fish family, and to identify the daily impact of surgeonfish species on the EAM, data on their biomass (gm−2) and grazing intensity (total bitesm−2day−1) were combined with EAM productivity estimates (gCm−2day−1). EAM productivity was greatest in windward and shallow sites, and herbivorous fish biomass mirrored this pattern. Yet, there was no difference in the EAM standing crop or grazing intensity among habitats. In the most productive habitat (windward-shallow), grazer/detritivore surgeonfish species accounted for 74{\%} of the total herbivore biomass (gm−2), took 51{\%} of the total bites (m−2day−1), and removed an estimated 73{\%} of daily EAM productivity (gCm−2day−1). This study quantifies the role of surgeonfish in maintaining EAM biomass, and highlights their possible contribution to preventing shifts from coral- to algal-dominance following disturbance.},

abstract = {Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90{\%}. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50{\%} while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.},

Within coralreef systems, the parrot"shes (Labridae) are widely viewed as a key functional group in facilitating the recovery of reefs from recurrent disturbances. Although parrot"shes are commonly viewed as herbivores, exerting top- down control of algal communities, their unique jaws allow them to feed on almost all coral- reef substratum types. Consequently, parrot"sh are the primary agents responsible for a number of key ecological processes on coral reefs, namely, bioerosion, sediment production and transport, provision of space for coral settlement, and predation of live coral colonies. The parrot"shes, however, cannot be considered a uniform group.!Their functional roles are highly dependent on species feeding mode (scrapers, excavators, and browsers) and body size, with larger individuals having a disproportionately greater effect on the dynamics of benthic communities than smaller conspeci"cs. Parrot"sh are ubiquitous on tropical reefs worldwide, yet there is strong spatial structuring in the taxonomic and functional composition of the group. This spatial variation has been shaped by their biogeographic history, the productivity of their environment, and the habitat requirements of individual taxa. Over recent decades, increasing "shing pressure and habitat destruction have had a dramatic impact on the structure of parrot"sh assemblages, and as a consequence, on many reefs, normal ecosystem processes have been disrupted. Indeed, reef systems with severely depleted parrot"sh communities are less resilient to anthropogenic or natural environmental perturbations. Management strategies for the protection of this unique and critical functional group are urgently needed if we are to maintain the diversity, resilience, and structure of coral- reef ecosystems.},

While the contribution of a warming climate to the loss of live coral cover has been well documented across large spatial and temporal scales, the associated effects on fish have not. Here, we respond to recent and repeated calls to assess the importance of local management in conserving coral reefs in the context of global climate change. Such information is important, as coral reef fish assemblages are the most species dense vertebrate communities on earth, contributing critical ecosystem functions and providing crucial ecosystem services to human societies in tropical countries. Our assessment of the impacts of the 1998 mass bleaching event on coral cover, reef structural complexity, and reef associated fishes spans 7 countries, 66 sites and 26 degrees of latitude in the Indian Ocean. Using Bayesian meta-analysis we show that changes in the size structure, diversity and trophic composition of the reef fish community have followed coral declines. Although the ocean scale integrity of these coral reef ecosystems has been lost, it is positive to see the effects are spatially variable at multiple scales, with impacts and vulnerability affected by geography but not management regime. Existing no-take marine protected areas still support high biomass of fish, however they had no positive affect on the ecosystem response to large-scale disturbance. This suggests a need for future conservation and management efforts to identify and protect regional refugia, which should be integrated into existing management frameworks and combined with policies to improve system-wide resilience to climate variation and change.},

abstract = {Much research on coral reefs has documented differential declines in coral and associated organisms. In order to contextualise this general degradation, research on community composition is necessary in the context of varied disturbance histories and the biological processes and physical features thought to retard or promote recovery. We conducted a spatial assessment of coral reef communities across five reefs of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, with known disturbance histories, and assessed patterns of coral cover and community composition related to a range of other variables thought to be important for reef dynamics. Two of the reefs had not been extensively disturbed for at least 15 years prior to the surveys. Three of the reefs had been severely impacted by crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching approximately a decade before the surveys, from which only one of them was showing signs of recovery based on independent surveys. We incorporated wave exposure (sheltered and exposed) and reef zone (slope, crest and flat) into our design, providing a comprehensive assessment of the spatial patterns in community composition on these reefs. Categorising corals into life history groupings, we document major coral community differences in the unrecovered reefs, compared to the composition and covers found on the undisturbed reefs. The recovered reef, despite having similar coral cover, had a different community composition from the undisturbed reefs, which may indicate slow successional processes, or a different natural community dominance pattern due to hydrology and other oceanographic factors. The variables that best correlated with patterns in the coral community among sites included the density of juvenile corals, herbivore fish biomass, fish species richness and the cover of macroalgae. Given increasing impacts to the Great Barrier Reef, efforts to mitigate local stressors will be imperative to encouraging coral communities to persist into the future.},

abstract = {IUCN Global Marine Programme Founded in 1958, IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature) brings together states, government agencies and a diverse range of non-governmental organizations in a unique world partnership: over 100 members in all, spread across some 140 countries. As a Union, IUCN seeks to influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable. The IUCN Global Marine Programme provides vital linkages for the Union and its members to all the IUCN activities that deal with marine issues, including projects and initiatives of the Regional offices and the six IUCN Commissions. The IUCN Global Marine Programme works on issues such as integrated coastal and marine management, fisheries, marine protected areas, large marine ecosystems, coral reefs, marine invasives and protection of high and deep seas. The Nature Conservancy The mission of The Nature Conservancy is to preserve the plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive. The Conservancy launched the Global Marine Initiative in 2002 to protect and restore the most resilient examples of ocean and coastal ecosystems in ways that benefit marine life, local communities and economies. The Conservancy operates over 100 marine conservation projects in more than 21 countries and 22 US states; they work with partners across seascapes and landscapes through transformative strategies and integrated planning and action. The focus is on: (1) Setting priorities for marine conservation using ecoregional assessments and tools for ecosystem based management; (2) Ensuring coral reef survival by creating resilient networks of marine protected areas; (3) Restoring and conserving coastal habitats by utilizing innovative new methods; (4) Building support for marine conservation through strategic partnerships and working to shape global and national policies. Marine conservation in The Nature Conservancy builds upon the organization's core strengths: achieving demonstrable results; working with a wide range of partners, including non-traditional partners; science-based, robust conservation planning methodologies; our experience with transactions; and, perhaps most importantly, our ability and commitment to back up our strategies with human, financial and political capital.

abstract = {Humans are an increasingly dominant driver of Earth's biological communities, but differentiating human impacts from natural drivers of ecosystem state is crucial. Herbivorous fish play a key role in maintaining coral dominance on coral reefs, and are widely affected by human activities, principally fishing. We assess the relative importance of human and biophysical (habitat and oceanographic) drivers on the biomass of five herbivorous functional groups among 33 islands in the central nd western Pacific Ocean. Human impacts were clear for some, but not all, herbivore groups. Biomass of browsers, large excavators, and of all herbivores combinded declined rapidly with increasing human population density, whereas grazers, scrapers, and detritivores displayed no relationship. Sea-surface temperature had significant but opposing efffects on the biomass of detritivores (positive) and browers (negative). Similarly, the biomass of scrapers, grazers, and detritivores correlated with habitat structural complexity; however, relationships were group specific. Finally, the biomass of browsers and large excavators was related to island geomorphology, both peaking on low-lying islands and atolls. The substantial variability in herbivore populations explained by natural biophysical drivers highlights the need for locally appropriate management targets on coral reefs.},

abstract = {1. Functional redundancy contributes to resilience if different species in the same functional group respond to disturbance in different ways (response diversity). If species in a functional group perform their functional role at different spatial scales (cross-scale redundancy), they are expected to respond differently to scale-specific disturbance. Consequently, variance in the spatial scales over which species perform their functional role may provide a proxy for resil- ience. 2. Coral reefs are diverse systems that provide key ecosystem services and are subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Algal grazing by herbivorous fish contributes to the maintenance of coral-dominated reefs. To date, there has been little evaluation of the traits driving response diversity among herbivorous fish and how this relates to coral recovery fol- lowing acute disturbances. 3. Using body size as a proxy for the spatial scale at which fish function, we tested whether cross-scale redundancy in herbivores was an effective indicator of response diversity and coral recovery on 21 reefs monitored through a climate-induced disturbance that caused coral bleaching and widespread coral mortality. 4. When herbivorous fish assemblages that operated over a broader range of spatial scales were present on reefs prior to disturbance, the reefs were more likely to recover to coral-dom- inated states after the disturbance. After the temperature-induced disturbance, the loss of small herbivores was compensated for through increases in large herbivores. This was indica- tive of high response diversity and drove the overall increase in herbivore biomass at recover- ing sites. These compensatory mechanisms were not found at sites where herbivores operated over a narrower range of spatial scales. 5. Synthesis and applications. Cross-scale redundancy provides managers with an indicator of coral reef resilience, although the contribution of cross-scale redundancy to resilience will vary among sites. Maintaining high cross-scale redundancy at a given site requires that no size classes of reef herbivores are disproportionately depleted by fishing. Balanced harvesting, where species are all fished in proportion to their potential production, would help achieve this.},

abstract = {The function of species has been recognized as critical for the maintenance of ecosystems within desired states. However, there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of interspecific differences in the functional roles of organisms, particularly with regard to the spatial scales over which functional impact is exerted. This has implications for the delivery of function and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. In this study we assessed the allometric relationship between foraging movements and fish body length at three sites, for 20 species of herbivorous reef fishes within four different functional groups: browsers, farmers, grazer/ detritivores, and scraper/excavators. The relationship between vulnerability of species to fishing and their scale of foraging was also examined. We present empirical evidence of the strong, positive, log-linear relationship between the scale of foraging movement and fish body length. This relationship was consistent among sites and between the two different movement metrics used. Phylogeny did not affect these results. Functional groups foraged over contrasting ranges of spatial scales; for example, scraper/excavators performed their role over a wide range of scales, whereas browsers were represented by few species and operated over a narrow range of scales. Overfishing is likely not only to remove species operating at large scales, but also to remove the browser group as a whole. Large fishes typically have a significant role in removing algae on reefs, and browsers are key to controlling macroalgae and reversing shifts to macroalgal-dominated states. This vulnerability to exploitation has serious consequences for the ability of fish assemblages to deliver their functional role in the face of anthropogenic impacts. However, identification of the scales at which herbivorous fish assemblages are susceptible to fishing provides managers with critical knowledge to design management strategies to support coral-dominated reefs by maintaining function at the spatial scales at which vulnerable species operate.},

abstract = {The lined bristletooth, Ctenochaetus striatus, and the brown surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, are among the most abundant surgeonfishes on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Yet, the functional role of these species has been the focus of an ongoing debate lasting at least six decades. Specifically, to what extent are C. striatus herbivorous like the visually similar A. nigrofuscus? To address this question, we used natural feeding surfaces, covered with late successional stage reef-grown algal turfs, to examine turf algal removal by the two species. Surfaces exposed to C. striatus in laboratory experiments exhibited no significant reductions in turf length or area covered by turfing algae. In marked contrast, A. nigrofuscus reduced turf length by 51{\%} and area covered by turfing algae by 15{\%} in 1 h. The gut contents of specimens from the reef revealed that A. nigrofuscus predominantly ingests algae (the dominant item in 79.6–94.7{\%} of gut content quadrats), while C. striatus ingests detritus and sediments (dominant in 99.6–100{\%} of quadrats). Therefore, C. striatus ingests detritus and sediment, leaving mature algal turfs relatively intact, while A. nigrofuscus directly removes and ingests turf algae. The function of C. striatus differs from cropping herbivorous surgeonfishes such as A. nigrofuscus. On coral reefs, C. striatus brush detrital aggregates from algal turfs, removing microorganisms, organic detritus and inorganic sediment. Confusion over the functional role of C. striatus may stem from an inability to fit it into a single functional category.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},
