abstract = {A scarcity of life-history data currently exists for many exploited coral reef fishes, hindering our ability to interpret fishery dynamics and develop sound conservation policies. In particular, parrotfishes (Family Labridae) represent a ubiquitous and ecologically important group that is increasingly prevalent in commercial and artisanal fisheries worldwide. We used both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to examine the effect of life histories on vulnerability to overexploitation in parrotfishes. Vulnerability for each species was derived from independent measures associated with both temporal (20-year catch records) and spatial datasets. Most life- history traits examined were significant predictors of vul- nerability across species, but their relative utility differed considerably. Length-based traits (e.g., lengths at maturity and sex change, maximum length) were generally superior to age-based traits (e.g., life span), but one age-based trait, age at female maturation, was the best predictor. The results suggest that easily derived metrics such as maximum length can be effective measures of sensitivity to exploitation when applied to phylogenetically related multispecies assemblages, but more holistic and comprehensive age-based demographic data should be sought, especially in data-deficient and heavily impacted regions. Given the increasing prevalence of parrotfishes in the global coral reef harvest, species-specific responses demonstrate the capacity for heavy fishing pressure to alter parrotfish assemblages considerably.

abstract = {Abstract Increased frequency of disturbances and anthropogenic activities are predicted to have a devastating impact on coral reefs that will ultimately change the composition of reef associated fish communities. We reviewed and analysed studies that document the effects of disturbance-mediated coral loss on coral reef fishes. Meta-analysis of 17 independent studies revealed that 62{\%} of fish species declined in abundance within 3 years of disturbances that resulted in {\textgreater}10{\%} decline in coral cover. Abundances of species reliant on live coral for food and shelter consistently declined during this time frame, while abundance of some species that feed on invertebrates, algae and/or detritus increased. The response of species, particularly those expected to benefit from the immediate loss of coral, is, however, variable and is attributed to erratic replenishment of stocks, ecological versatility of species and sublethal responses, such as changes in growth, body condition and feeding rates. The diversity of fish communities was found to be negatively and linearly correlated to disturbance-mediated coral loss. Coral loss {\textgreater}20{\%} typically resulted in a decline in species richness of fish communities, although diversity may initially increase following small declines in coral cover from high coverage. Disturbances that result in an immediate loss of habitat complexity (e.g. severe tropical storms), have a greater impact on fishes from all trophic levels, compared with disturbances that kill corals, but leave the reef framework intact (e.g. coral bleaching and outbreaks of Acanthaster planci). This is most evident among small bodied species and suggests the long-term consequences of coral loss through coral bleaching and crown-of-thorn starfish outbreaks may be much more substantial than the short-term effects currently documented.},

Bottom-up effects of prey (primary producer) biodiversity are also well known. However, the role of consumer diversity in affecting community structure or ecosystem function is not well understood. Here, we show that herbivore species richness can be critical for maintaining the structure and function of coral reefs. In two experiments over 2 years, we constructed large cages enclosing single herbivore species, equal densities of mixed species of herbivores, or excluding herbivores and assessed effects on both seaweeds and corals. When compared with single-herbivore treatments, mixed-herbivore treatments lowered macroalgal abundance by 54-76{\%}, enhanced cover of crustose coralline algae (preferred recruitment sites for corals) by 52-64{\%}, increased coral cover by 22{\%}, and prevented coral mortality. Complementary feeding by herbivorous fishes drove the herbivore richness effects, because macroalgae were unable to effectively deter fishes with different feeding strategies. Maintaining herbivore species richness appears critical for preserving coral reefs, because complementary feeding by diverse herbivores produces positive, but indirect, effects on corals, the foundation species for the ecosystem.},

abstract = {Parrotfishes are a group of herbivores that play an important functional role in structuring benthic communities on coral reefs. Increasingly, these fish are being targeted by fishermen, and resultant declines in biomass and abundance may have severe consequences for the dynamics and regeneration of coral reefs. However, the impact of overfishing extends beyond declining fish stocks. It can also lead to demographic changes within species populations where mean body size is reduced. The effect of reduced mean body size on population dynamics is well described in literature but virtually no information exists on how this may influence important ecological functions. The study investigated how one important function, scraping (i.e., the capacity to remove algae and open up bare substratum for coral larval settlement), by three common species of parrotfishes (Scarus niger, Chlorurus sordidus, and Chlorurus strongylocephalus) on coral reefs at Zanzibar (Tanzania) was influenced by the size of individual fishes. There was a non-linear relationship between body size and scraping function for all species examined, and impact through scraping was also found to increase markedly when fish reached a size of 15–20 cm. Thus, coral reefs which have a high abundance and biomass of parrotfish may nonetheless be functionally impaired if dominated by small-sized individuals. Reductions in mean body size within parrotfish populations could, therefore, have functional impacts on coral reefs that previously have been overlooked.},

abstract = {It has become almost paradigmatic in the coral reef literature that fishing-induced reductions of parrotfish abundance cause benthic phase shifts from coral to mac- roalgal dominance. This study examined the alternatives of top-down control of the benthos by parrotfish density and bottom-up control of parrotfish density by the benthos at four Philippine islands in a long-term (7.5–30 years) “natural experiment”. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) demonstrated that fishing reduced parrotfish density sig- nificantly at two islands (Sumilon, Mantigue), but not sig- nificantly at two other islands (Apo, Selinog). There was no evidence that cover of hard coral decreased, nor macroal- gal cover increased, in fished areas relative to NTMRs, no evidence that parrotfish density affected hard coral cover significantly, and thus no evidence of top-down, fishing- induced benthic phase shifts at all four islands. There was, however, compelling evidence that benthos (cover of dead substrata and hard coral) exerted strong bottom-up control on parrotfish density. This bottom-up control was demon- strated most clearly by major environmental disturbances (e.g. typhoons, coral bleaching) that changed benthic habi- tat and, subsequently, parrotfish density. As hard coral cover declined (and cover of dead substratum increased), parrotfish density increased and vice versa. This response occurred in both major parrotfish feeding guilds (scrapers and excavators). This long-term study on heavily fished coral reefs suggests that the benthos drives the parrotfish, not the other way around. The paradigm of fishing-induced benthic phase shifts may not apply to all coral reefs at all times. Multiple drivers of benthic change on coral reefs should always be considered.},

abstract = {Coral reefs can exist as coral- and macroalgae-dominated habitats often separated by only a few hundred metres. While herbivorous fish are known to depress the abundance of algae and help maintain the function of coral-dominated habitats, less is known about their influence in algae-dominated habitats. Here, we quantified herbivorous fish and benthic algal communities over a 6 mo period in coral-dominated (back-reef) and algal-dominated (lagoon) habitats in a relatively undisturbed fringing coral reef (Ningaloo, Western Australia). Simulta - neously, we tested the effects of herbivorous fish on algal recruitment in both habitats using recruitment tiles and fish exclusion cages. The composition of established algal communities differed consistently between habitats, with the back-reef hosting a more diverse community than the Sargassum-dominated lagoon. However, total algal biomass and cover only differed between habitats in autumn, coinciding with maximum Sargassum biomass. The back-reef hosted high coral cover and a diverse herbivorous fish community, with herbivore biomass an order of magni- tude greater than the lagoon. Despite these differences in herbivore composition, exclusion of large herbivores had a similar positive effect to foliose macroalgae recruitment on experimental tiles in both back-reef and lagoon habitats. Additionally, territorial damselfish found in the back- reef increased turf algae cover and decreased crustose coralline algae cover on recruitment tiles. Collectively, our results show that disparate herbivorous fish communities in coral- and algae- dominated habitats are similarly able to limit the recruitment of foliose macroalgae, but suggest that when herbivorous fish biomass and diversity are relatively low, macroalgal communities are able to escape herbivore control through increased growth.},

abstract = {On coral reefs, herbivorous fishes consume benthic primary producers and regulate competition between fleshy algae and reef-building corals. Many of these species are also important fishery targets, yet little is known about their global status. Using a large-scale synthesis of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, we examine variability in abundance and biomass of herbivorous reef fishes and explore evidence for fishing impacts globally and within regions. We show that biomass is more than twice as high in locations not accessible to fisheries relative to fisheries-accessible locations. Although there are large biogeographic differences in total biomass, the effects of fishing are consistent in nearly all regions. We also show that exposure to fishing alters the structure of the herbivore community by disproportionately reducing biomass of large-bodied functional groups (scraper/excavators, browsers, grazer/detritivores), while increasing biomass and abundance of territorial algal-farming damselfishes (Pomacentridae). The browser functional group that consumes macroalgae and can help to prevent coral–macroalgal phase shifts appears to be most susceptible to fishing. This fishing down the herbivore guild probably alters the effectiveness of these fishes in regulating algal abundance on reefs. Finally, data from remote and unfished locations provide important baselines for setting management and conservation targets for this important group of fishes.},

We examined the relationships between diet, feeding rate, alimentary tract structure and patterns of digestion for 2 reef herbivores commonly found on the Great Barrier Reef, Siganus doliatus and S. lineatus. Despite their similar morphology, the 2 species exhibited distinct feeding behaviours and significantly different feeding rates, diets and movements of digesta through the alimentary tract. S. doliatus displayed a typical herbivore diurnal feeding pattern, taking an average 9.7 bites min(-1) over the main part of the feeding day and with a diet dominated by red thallate algae (primarily Laurencia spp., Eucheuma sp., Halymenia sp, and Gracilaria sp,) and red and green filamentous algae. S. lineatus was not. observed taking a single bite from the reef substratum in {\textgreater} 100 h of underwater observations. The stomach contents of S. lineatus were dominated by amorphous organic matter (detritus). Gut passage rates suggest that S. lineatus is feeding nocturnally or during crepuscular periods. We Suggest that these 2 species have distinct functional roles, with S. doliatus being a grazer of reef turf algae and S. lineatus primarily a grazer of off-reef detrital aggregates. This versatility of ecosystem function in closely related species provides further evidence that functional roles do not necessarily divide along taxonomic lines. The results highlight the importance of validating ecosystem function on a species-by-species basis.},

abstract = {The relative rates of carbon fixed by primary producers vs. consumption by primary con- sumers shape the community of organisms in ecosystems. On coral reefs, it is important to understand the demography of algae, given known competitive dynamics with reef-building corals. Numerous studies have shown that fleshy algal abundance is enhanced in the absence of top-down control by herbivores on coral reefs. However, fewer studies have quantified and compared rates of production by the benthic fleshy algal community and consumption by herbivores. Here, we estimate a budget for fleshy algal growth and herbivorous fish consumption on a Hawaiian coral reef based upon integration of field- measured and taxonomically specific variables. Data were collected at Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area, Maui, established in 2009, in which taking of herbivorous fish and urchins is prohibited. Daily algal production was determined by quantifying benthic community composition, standing stock of algal biomass, and growth rates of common algal components. Consumption was determined using distributions of biomass and size classes of herbivorous fish species, consumption rates of herbivores on different algal species, and herbivore bite sizes. Our results show that throughout the first five years of herbivore protection, algal production consistently exceeded the grazing capacity of the herbivorous fish assemblage, but by a diminishing margin since 2010 (consumption 20.8{\%} of production) to the end of the study in 2014 (consumption 67.0{\%} of production). Further, larger size classes of herbivorous fishes in the scraper/excavator herbivore guild contributed more to consumption in later years, which could have addi- tional feedbacks that promote reef-building taxa. Projecting the budget using data from a neighboring dec- ades-long protected herbivorous fish assemblage indicated that the production and consumption budget for Kahekili could become balanced in future with continued management.},

abstract = {Despite high diversity and abundance of nominally herbivorous fishes on coral reefs, recent studies indicate that only a small subset of taxa are capable of removing dominant macroalgae once these become established. This limited functional redundancy highlights the potential vulnerability of coral reefs to disturbance and stresses the need to assess the functional role of individual species of herbivores. However, our knowledge of species-specific patterns in macroalgal consumption is limited geographically, and there is a need to determine the extent to which patterns observed in specific reefs can be generalised at larger spatial scales. In this study, video cameras were used to quantify rates of macroalgae consumption by fishes in two coral reefs located at a similar latitude in opposite sides of Australia: the Keppel Islands in the Great Barrier Reef (eastern coast) and Ningaloo Reef (western coast). The community of nominally herbivorous fish was also characterised in both systems to determine whether potential differences in the species observed feeding on macroalgae were related to spatial dissimilarities in herbivore community composition. The total number of species observed biting on the dominant brown alga Sargassum myriocystum differed dramatically among the two systems, with 23 species feeding in Ningaloo, compared with just 8 in the Keppel Islands. Strong differences were also found in the species composition and total biomass of nominally herbivorous fish, which was an order of magnitude higher in Ningaloo. However, despite such marked differences in the diversity, biomass, and community composition of resident herbivorous fishes, Sargassum consumption was dominated by only four species in both systems, with Naso unicornis and Kyphosus vaigiensis consistently emerging as dominant feeders of macroalgae.},

spanning the central-western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess
the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in
determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy
algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the
major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether
anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural
relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy,
oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence
benthic community composition; overlooking these factors may bias
expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing
biomass above a relatively low threshold ({\~{}} 10–20 kg ha−1) may
also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a
tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore
populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at
inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain
important macroscale processes, even at chronically disturbed
reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was
substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences,
suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were
superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of
strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores
their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral
reef management and restoration that are realistic within the
context of local conditions.},

abstract = {Sediments are widely accepted as a threat to coral reefs but our understanding of their ecological impacts is limited. Evidence has suggested that benthic sediments bound within the epilithic algal matrix (EAM) suppress reef fish herbivory, a key ecological process maintaining reef resilience. An experimental combination of caging and sediment addition treatments were used to investigate the effects of sediment pulses on herbivory and EAMs and to determine whether sediment addition could trigger a positive-feedback loop, leading to deep, sediment-rich turfs. A 1-week pulsed sediment addition resulted in rapid increases in algal turf length with effects comparable to those seen in herbivore exclusion cages. Contrary to the hypothesised positive-feedback mechanism, benthic sediment loads returned to natural levels within 3 weeks, however, the EAM turfs remained almost 60{\%} longer for at least 3 months. While reduced herbivore density is widely understood to be a major threat to reefs, we show that acute disturbances to reef sediments elicit similar ecological responses in the EAM. With reefs increasingly threatened by both reductions in herbivore biomass and altered sediment fluxes, the development of longer turfs may become more common on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Patterns of ecological specialization offer invaluable information about ecosystems. Yet, specialization is rarely quantified across several ecological niche axes and variables beyond the link between morphological and dietary specialization have received little attention. Here, we provide a quantitative evaluation of ecological specialization in a coral reef fish assemblage (f. Acanthuridae) along one fundamental and two realized niche axes. Specifically, we examined ecological specialization in 10 surgeonfish species with regards to morphology and two realized niche axes associated with diet and foraging microhabitat utilization using a recently developed multidimensional framework. We then investigated the potential relationships between morphological and behavioural specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological specialization showed no relationship with dietary specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was inverted: species with specialized morphologies were microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors relationships found in plant–pollinator communities and may also be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization into ecomorphological frameworks. On coral reefs, it appears that morphotypes commonly perceived as most generalized may, in fact, be specialized in exploiting flat and easily accessible microhabitats.},

abstract = {On coral reefs, herbivory is a key factor in maintaining coral-dominated systems. Despite this, few studies have investigated the process of herbivory over broad spatial scales. We examined the patterns of herbivory across sites spanning 900 km along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Assays were used to directly quantify the removal rates of the brown macroalgae Sargassum, while feeding rates of herbivorous fishes were measured using remote underwater video. Removal rates of Sargassum by herbivores exhibited a significant regional decline from north to south, driven primarily by changes in the behaviour of the 4 most dominant species and to a lesser extent by a regional decline in herbivore diversity. Whilst the 4 species (Naso unicornis, Kyphosus vaigiensis, Siganus doliatus and S. canaliculatus) consistently dominated feeding, jointly accounting for 85, 99 and 98{\%} of mass standardised bites within the north, central and southern regions, respectively, they recorded over an order of magnitude fewer bites in the south. Interestingly, the decline in bites and the lower feeding diversity was not a result of lower herbivore biomass or density in the southern region. Rather, the major difference between fish herbivory among regions was the feeding propensity of the 4 dominant feeders toward the transplanted Sargassum. Reefs with intact and structurally comparable herbivore communities therefore cannot be assumed to have the same realised functional impact on the reef. Local behaviour may be an important factor.},

abstract = {Teleost fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates on Earth. On tropical coral reefs, their species richness exceeds 6000 species; one tenth of total vertebrate biodiversity. A large proportion of this diversity is composed of cryptobenthic reef fishes (CRFs): bottom-dwelling, morphologically or behaviourally cryptic species typically less than 50 mm in length. Yet, despite their diversity and abundance, these fishes are both poorly defined and understood. Herein we provide a new quantitative definition and synthesise current knowledge on the diversity, distribution and life history of CRFs. First, we use size distributions within families to define 17 core CRF families as characterised by the high prevalence ({\textgreater}10{\%}) of small-bodied species ({\textless}50 mm). This stands in strong contrast to 42 families of large reef fishes, in which virtually no small-bodied species have evolved. We posit that small body size has allowed CRFs to diversify at extremely high rates, primarily by allowing for fine partitioning of microhabitats and facilitation of allopatric reproductive isolation; yet, we are far from understanding and documenting the biodiversity of CRFs. Using rates of description since 1758, we predict that approximately 30 new species of cryptobenthic species will be described per year until 2050 (approximately twice the annual rate compared to large fishes). Furthermore, we predict that by the year 2031, more than half of the described coral reef fish biodiversity will consist of CRFs. These fishes are the 'hidden half' of vertebrate biodiversity on coral reefs. Notably, global geographic coverage and spatial resolution of quantitative data on CRF communities is uniformly poor, which further emphasises the remarkable reservoir of biodiversity that is yet to be discovered. Although small body size may have enabled extensive diversification within CRF families, small size also comes with a suite of ecological challenges that affect fishes' capacities to feed, survive and reproduce; we identify a range of life-history adaptations that have enabled CRFs to overcome these limitations. In turn, these adaptations bestow a unique socio-ecological role on CRFs, which includes a key role in coral reef trophodynamics by cycling trophic energy provided by microscopic prey to larger consumers. Although small in body size, the ecology and evolutionary history of CRFs may make them a critical component of coral-reef food webs; yet our review also shows that these fishes are highly susceptible to a variety of anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding the consequences of these changes for CRFs and coral reef ecosystems will require us to shed more light on this frequently overlooked but highly diverse and abundant guild of coral reef fishes.},

Our objective was to use a multivariate data set to determine whether the land use conversion from native forest (NF) to hoop pine plantation and the following rotation and site preparation practices had altered SOM quality at three adjacent sites of NF, first (1R) and second rotation (2R, including tree planting row (2R-T) and windrow of harvest residues (2R-W)) of hoop pine plantations in southeast Queensland, Australia. Cross-polarization magic angle spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS 13C NMR) spectroscopy and sequential hot water and acid hydrolysis were conducted on SOM fractions separated by wet-sieving and density fractionation procedures to characterize SOM quantitative and qualitative relevant parameters, including carbon (C) functional groups, C and nitrogen (N) contents, C/N ratios, and C and N recalcitrant indices. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of these multivariate parameters together indicated a complicated interaction between physical protection and biochemical recalcitrance, making the land use and management induced changes of SOM quality more complex. Knowledge of PCA based on the refined set of 41 SOM quantitative and qualitative parameters identified that principal component 1 (PC1), which explained 55.7{\%} of the total variance, was most responsible for the management induced changes in soil processes. This was reflected by the dynamics of SOM regarding the aspects of total stock, soil basal and substrate induced respirations, gross and net N mineralization and nitrification, and microbial biomass, microbial diversity of C utilization patterns. Further, the macroaggregates (F250-2000 {\^{I}}¼m) and the C/N ratio of acid extracts of SOM physical fractions, which represented the most informative and unique variables loading on PC1, might be the most promising physical and chemical measures for SOM quality assessment of land use and management impacts in subtropical Australian forests. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The reef flat is one of the largest and most distinctive habitats on coral reefs, yet its role in reef trophodynamics is poorly understood. Evolutionary evidence suggests that reef flat colonization by grazing fishes was a major innovation that permitted the exploitation of new space and trophic resources. However, the reef flat is hydrodynamically challenging, subject to high predation risks and covered with sediments that inhibit feeding by grazers. To explore these opposing influences, we examine the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as a model system. We focus on grazing herbivores that directly access algal primary productivity in the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). By assessing abundance, biomass, and potential fish productivity, we explore the potential of the reef flat to support key ecosystem processes and its ability to maintain fisheries yields. On the GBR, the reef flat is, by far, the most important habitat for turf‐grazing fishes, supporting an estimated 79{\%} of individuals and 58{\%} of the total biomass of grazing surgeonfishes, parrotfishes, and rabbitfishes. Approximately 59{\%} of all (reef‐wide) turf algal productivity is removed by reef flat grazers. The flat also supports approximately 75{\%} of all grazer biomass growth. Our results highlight the evolutionary and ecological benefits of occupying shallow‐water habitats (permitting a ninefold population increase). The acquisition of key locomotor and feeding traits has enabled fishes to access the trophic benefits of the reef flat, outweighing the costs imposed by water movement, predation, and sediments. Benthic assemblages on reefs in the future may increasingly resemble those seen on reef flats today, with low coral cover, limited topographic complexity, and extensive EAM. Reef flat grazing fishes may therefore play an increasingly important role in key ecosystem processes and in sustaining future fisheries yields.},

abstract = {Metrics of foraging by herbivorous reef fishes have been shown to vary across space and time, and among species. However, little work has explicitly assessed how fish use space within their foraging ranges, or characterised relative foraging mobility in response to habitat condition. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding the functional impact of reef herbivores, and how spatially explicit functional roles may be modified by future reef degradation. In this study, we assessed the influence of among-site variation in habitat condition, competition and potential predation risk on the short-term foraging range of 2 species of parrotfish, Scarus niger and S. frenatus, on mid-shelf reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Foraging ranges were evaluated using 3 metrics: (1) inter-foray distance and the (2) area and (3) shape of the short-term foraging range. The primary predictor of these metrics of foraging behaviour was coral cover. Inter-foray distance de creased with increasing coral cover for both S. niger and S. frenatus, and foraging ranges became more circular with increasing coral cover. Competitor abundance was a secondary driver of foraging behaviour, whereas potential predation had no detectable effect. This research provides a fine-scale understanding of how habitat condition and competition among herbivores shapes the spatial scales at which herbivores interact with their environment in the short term, and at which they perform functions essential for coral reef resilience. Critically, the study suggests that predicted changes in coral cover are likely to alter the way reef herbivores forage, and will shape the extent to which they can compensate for declining habitat condition through changes in their feeding behaviour.},

scales at community and macroecological levels. This study
evaluated the drivers of reef fish growth across a large gradient
of environmental variables and a range of morphological and
behavioural traits. We compiled Von Bertalanffy Growth parameters
for reef fishes and standardized K relative to species maximum
sizes, obtaining Kmax. We then modelled the response of Kmax to
body size, diet, body shape, position relative to the reef,
schooling behaviour, sea surface temperature, pelagic net primary
productivity and ageing method, while accounting for phylogenetic
structure in the data. The final model explained 61.5{\%} of the
variation in Kmax and contained size, temperature, diet, method
and position. Body size explained 64{\%} of the modelled Kmax
variability, while the other variables explained between 6{\%}
(temperature) and 2.5{\%} (position). Kmax steadily decreased with
body size and increased with temperature. All else being equal,
herbivores/macroalgivores and pelagic reef fishes had higher
growth rates than the other groups. Moreover, length?frequency
ageing tended to overestimate Kmax compared to other methods
(e.g. otolith's rings). Our results are consistent with (a)
metabolic theory that predicts body size and temperature
dependence of physiological rates; and (b) ecological theory that
implies influence of resource availability and acquisition on
growth. At last, we use machine learning to accurately predict
growth coefficients for combinations of traits and environmental
settings. Our study helps to bridge the gap between individual

of fish growth in the ecosystem process of biomass accumulation.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide a number of ecosystem services including coastal defense from storms, the generation of building materials, and fisheries. It is increasingly clear that the management of reef resources requires an ecosystem approach in which extractive activities are weighed against the needs of the ecosystem and its functions rather than solely those of the fishery. Here, I use a spatially explicit simulation model of a Caribbean coral reef to examine the ecosystem requirements for grazing which is primarily conducted by parrotfishes (Scaridae). The model allows the impact of fishing grazers to be assessed in the wider context of other ecosystem processes including coral-algal competition, hurricanes, and mass extinction of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum. Using a new analytical model of scarid grazing, it is estimated that parrotfishes can only maintain between 10{\%} and 30{\%} of a structurally complex forereef in a grazed state. Predictions from this grazing model were then incorporated into a broader simulation model of the ecosystem. Simulations predict that scarid grazing is unable to maintain high levels of coral cover ({\textgreater} or = 30{\%}) when severe hurricanes occur on a decadal basis, such as occurs in parts of the northern Caribbean. However, reefs can withstand such intense disturbance when grazing is undertaken by both scarids and the urchin Diadema. Scarid grazing is predicted to allow recovery from hurricanes when their incidence falls to 20 years or less (e.g., most of Central and South America). Sensitivity analyses revealed that scarid grazing had the most acute impact on model behavior, and depletion led to the emergence of a stable, algal-dominated community state. Under conditions of heavy grazer depletion, coral cover was predicted to decline rapidly from an initial level of 30{\%} to less than 1{\%} within 40 years, even when hurricane frequency was low at 60 years. Depleted grazers caused a population bottleneck in juvenile corals in which algal overgrowth caused elevated levels of postsettlement mortality and resulted in a bimodal distribution of coral sizes. Several new hypotheses were generated including a region-wide change in the spatial heterogeneity of coral reefs following extinction of Diadema. The management of parrotfishes on Caribbean reefs is usually approached implicitly through no-take marine reserves. The model predicts that depletion of grazers in nonreserve areas can severely limit coral accretion. Other studies have shown that low coral accretion can reduce the structural complexity and therefore quality of the reef habitat for many organisms. A speculative yet rational inference from the model is that failure to manage scarid populations outside reserves will have a profoundly negative impact on the functioning of the reserve system and status of non-reserve reefs.},

abstract = {Many coral reefs worldwide have undergone phase shifts to alternate, degraded assemblages because of the combined effects of overfishing, declining water quality, and the direct and indirect impacts of climate change [1–9] . Here, we experimentally manipulated the density of large herbivorous fishes to test their influence on the resilience of coral assemblages in the aftermath of regional-scale bleaching in 1998, the largest coral mortality event recorded to date. The experiment was undertaken on the Great Barrier Reef, within a no-fishing reserve where coral abundances and diversity had been sharply reduced by bleaching [10] . In control areas, where fishes were abundant, algal abundance remained low, whereas coral cover almost doubled (to 20{\%}) over a 3 year period, primarily because of recruitment of species that had been locally extirpated by bleaching. In contrast, exclusion of large herbivorous fishes caused a dramatic explosion of macroalgae, which suppressed the fecundity, recruitment, and survival of corals. Consequently, management of fish stocks is a key component in preventing phase shifts and managing reef resilience. Importantly, local stewardship of fishing effort is a tractable goal for conservation of reefs, and this local action can also provide some insurance against larger-scale disturbances such as mass bleaching, which are impractical to manage directly.},

Within coralreef systems, the parrot"shes (Labridae) are widely viewed as a key functional group in facilitating the recovery of reefs from recurrent disturbances. Although parrot"shes are commonly viewed as herbivores, exerting top- down control of algal communities, their unique jaws allow them to feed on almost all coral- reef substratum types. Consequently, parrot"sh are the primary agents responsible for a number of key ecological processes on coral reefs, namely, bioerosion, sediment production and transport, provision of space for coral settlement, and predation of live coral colonies. The parrot"shes, however, cannot be considered a uniform group.!Their functional roles are highly dependent on species feeding mode (scrapers, excavators, and browsers) and body size, with larger individuals having a disproportionately greater effect on the dynamics of benthic communities than smaller conspeci"cs. Parrot"sh are ubiquitous on tropical reefs worldwide, yet there is strong spatial structuring in the taxonomic and functional composition of the group. This spatial variation has been shaped by their biogeographic history, the productivity of their environment, and the habitat requirements of individual taxa. Over recent decades, increasing "shing pressure and habitat destruction have had a dramatic impact on the structure of parrot"sh assemblages, and as a consequence, on many reefs, normal ecosystem processes have been disrupted. Indeed, reef systems with severely depleted parrot"sh communities are less resilient to anthropogenic or natural environmental perturbations. Management strategies for the protection of this unique and critical functional group are urgently needed if we are to maintain the diversity, resilience, and structure of coral- reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most highly productive marine
ecosystems, with a strong connection between herbivores and the
production of benthic algae. The epilithic algal matrix (EAM) is
a major source of primary production on coral reefs, and it is
one of the dominant benthic microhabitats, covering up to 80{\%} of
reef flats and back reefs and up to 70{\%} of reef slopes on
outer-shelf sites of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Although
herbivorous surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) are dominant members of
most reef fish assemblages, there is a lack of quantitative
information on their grazing impact, particularly those that feed
upon the EAM in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to investigate the role of surgeonfish in maintaining
algal turf biomass on coral reefs. Spatial patterns of EAM
productivity, and herbivorous fish biomass and grazing intensity
were quantified at different depths (deep vs. shallow) and
exposures (windward vs. leeward) of reef slope environments of
Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef. Surgeonfish were the
numerically-dominant EAM grazing fish family, and to identify the
daily impact of surgeonfish species on the EAM, data on their
biomass (gm−2) and grazing intensity (total bitesm−2day−1) were
combined with EAM productivity estimates (gCm−2day−1). EAM
productivity was greatest in windward and shallow sites, and
herbivorous fish biomass mirrored this pattern. Yet, there was no
difference in the EAM standing crop or grazing intensity among
habitats. In the most productive habitat (windward-shallow),
grazer/detritivore surgeonfish species accounted for 74{\%} of the
total herbivore biomass (gm−2), took 51{\%} of the total bites
(m−2day−1), and removed an estimated 73{\%} of daily EAM
productivity (gCm−2day−1). This study quantifies the role of
surgeonfish in maintaining EAM biomass, and highlights their
possible contribution to preventing shifts from coral- to
algal-dominance following disturbance.},

Estimates of roving herbivore impact based on dawn to dusk observations of feeding rates, measurement of bite sizes and relative abundance revealed that the Orpheus Island system was dominated by 3 species: Scarus rivulatus, Chlorurus microrhinos and Siganus doliatus. The estimated impact of all 3 species varied significantly across the reef depth gradient, with the rate of disturbance peaking at the crest and decreasing significantly down the slope and across the reef flat. The estimated species-specific disturbance levels suggested that during the course of a single month 104{\%} of a square metre area of the reef crest is grazed by S. rivulatus while 40{\%} is subject to grazing by C. microrhinos. A total of 26 cm3 of algal material is removed from the same area by S. doliatus. Overall, there was a 240-fold decrease in grazing activity across the reef flat from that at the crest. The pattern of grazing impact of the numerically dominant siganid and scarid fishes was negatively correlated with the distribution of macroalgae across the same reef gradient.

abstract = {Niche theory predicts that coexisting species minimise competition by evolving morphological or behavioural specialisations that allow them to spread out along resource axes such as space, diet and temporal activity. These specialisations define how a species interacts with its environment and, by extension, determine its functional role. Here, we examine the feeding niche of three species of coral reef-dwelling rabbitfishes (Siganidae, Siganus). By comparing aspects of their feeding behaviour (bite location, bite rate, foraging distance) with that of representative species from two other abundant herbivorous fish families, the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarus) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Acanthurus), we examine whether rabbitfishes have a feeding niche distinct from other members of the herbivore guild. Measurements of the penetration of the fishes' snouts and bodies into reef concavities when feeding revealed that rabbitfish fed to a greater degree from reef crevices and interstices than other herbivores. There was just a 40 {\%} overlap in the penetration-depth niche between rabbitfish and surgeonfish and a 45 {\%} overlap between rabbitfish and parrotfish, compared with the almost complete niche overlap (95 {\%}) recorded for parrotfish and surgeonfish along this spatial niche axis. Aspects of the morphology of rabbitfish which may contribute to this niche segregation include a comparatively longer, narrower snout and narrower head. Our results suggest that sympatric coexistence of rabbitfish and other reef herbivores is facilitated by segregation along a spatial (and potentially dietary) axis. This segregation results in a unique functional role for rabbitfishes among roving herbivores that of "crevice-browser": a group that specifically feeds on crevice-dwelling algal or benthic organisms. This functional trait may have implications for reef ecosystem processes in terms of controlling the successional development of crevice-based algal communities, reducing their potential to trigger macroalgal outbreaks.},

abstract = {The lined bristletooth, Ctenochaetus striatus, and the brown surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, are among the most abundant surgeonfishes on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Yet, the functional role of these species has been the focus of an ongoing debate lasting at least six decades. Specifically, to what extent are C. striatus herbivorous like the visually similar A. nigrofuscus? To address this question, we used natural feeding surfaces, covered with late successional stage reef-grown algal turfs, to examine turf algal removal by the two species. Surfaces exposed to C. striatus in laboratory experiments exhibited no significant reductions in turf length or area covered by turfing algae. In marked contrast, A. nigrofuscus reduced turf length by 51{\%} and area covered by turfing algae by 15{\%} in 1 h. The gut contents of specimens from the reef revealed that A. nigrofuscus predominantly ingests algae (the dominant item in 79.6–94.7{\%} of gut content quadrats), while C. striatus ingests detritus and sediments (dominant in 99.6–100{\%} of quadrats). Therefore, C. striatus ingests detritus and sediment, leaving mature algal turfs relatively intact, while A. nigrofuscus directly removes and ingests turf algae. The function of C. striatus differs from cropping herbivorous surgeonfishes such as A. nigrofuscus. On coral reefs, C. striatus brush detrital aggregates from algal turfs, removing microorganisms, organic detritus and inorganic sediment. Confusion over the functional role of C. striatus may stem from an inability to fit it into a single functional category.},

A method of particle assay was developed, consisting of nitric-acid digestion of tissue followed by collection of particles, electronic quantitation, and parallel morphological and chemical characterization. Nitric acid had minimum deleterious effects on control samples of titanium, cobalt-chromium alloy, and polyethylene particles, as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electronic measurements of the sizes of the particles. Acid digestion of twelve control samples of tissue, including tissue rich in hemosiderin, resulted in particle counts that were no higher than that in the digestion solution background. Other digestion preparations, including hydrochloric acid and sodium hypophosphate, were not as effective as nitric acid. With the low size limit of detection of approximately 0.58 micrometer, particle analysis of tissue adjacent to twenty retrieved total joint implants indicated a range of concentration of 0.85 to 141.85 x 10(9) particles per gram of tissue (dry weight). Although a few particles of more than 100 micrometers were detected, the mode of particle diameter from each sample ranged from the lower limit of detection (approximately 0.58 micrometer) to 0.79 micrometer. The findings of morphological studies and x-ray spectroscopy of isolated particles corresponded with those of light microscopy of the fibrous membranes. These data indicate that most of the particles in implant membranes are smaller than the resolution of the light microscope and that tissue digestion is necessary for quantitation and characterization.},

CORAL REEFS Volume: 32 Issue: 4 Pages: 937-947 Published: DEC 2013 Full Text Close AbstractClose Abstract Grazing on marine macroalgae is a key structuring process for coral reef communities. However, ocean acidification from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations is predicted to adversely affect many marine animals, while seaweed communities may benefit and prosper. We tested how exposure to different pCO(2) (400, 1,800 and 4,000 mu atm) may affect grazing on the green alga Ulva lactuca by herbivorous fish and sea urchins from the coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), either directly, by changing herbivore behaviour, or indirectly via changes in algal palatability. We also determined the effects of pCO(2) on algal tissue concentrations of protein and the grazing-deterrent secondary metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Grazing preferences and overall consumption were tested in a series of multiple-choice feeding experiments in the laboratory and in situ following exposure for 14 d (algae) and 28 d (herbivores). 4,000 mu atm had a significant effect on the biochemical composition and palatability of U. lactuca. No effects were observed at 1,800 relative to 400 mu atm (control). Exposure of U. lactuca to 4,000 mu atm resulted in a significant decrease in protein and increase in DMSP concentration. This coincided with a reduced preference for these algae by the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla and different herbivorous fish species in situ (Acanthuridae, Siganidae and Pomacanthidae). No feeding preferences were observed for the rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus under laboratory conditions. Exposure to elevated pCO(2) had no direct effect on the overall algal consumption by T. gratilla and S. rivulatus. Our results show that CO2 has the potential to alter algal palatability to different herbivores which could have important implications for algal abundance and coral community structure. The fact that pCO(2) effects were observed only at a pCO(2) of 4,000 mu atm, however, indicates that algal-grazer interactions may be resistant to predicted pCO(2) concentrations in the near future.},

abstract = {Macroalgal-feeding fishes are considered to be a key functional group on coral reefs due to their role in preventing phase shifts from coral to macroalgal domi- nance, and potentially reversing the shift should it occur. However, assessments of macroalgal herbivory using bio- assay experiments are primarily from systems with rela- tively high coral cover. This raises the question of whether continued functionality can be ensured in degraded sys- tems. It is clearly important to determine whether the species that remove macroalgae on coral-dominated reefs will still be present and performing significant algal removal on macroalgal-dominated reefs. We compared the identity and effectiveness of macroalgal-feeding fishes on reefs in two conditions post-disturbance—those regener- ating with high live coral cover (20–46 {\%}) and those degrading with high macroalgal cover (57–82 {\%}). Using filmed Sargassum bioassays, we found significantly dif- ferent Sargassum biomass loss between the two conditions; mean assay weight loss due to herbivory was 27.9 ± 4.9 {\%} on coral-dominated reefs and 2.2 ± 1.1 {\%} on reefs with high macroalgal cover. However, once standardised for the availability of macroalgae on the reefs, the rates of removal were similar between the two reef conditions (4.8 ± 4.1 gm-2 h-1 on coral-dominated and 5.3 ± 2.1 g m-2 h-1 on macroalgal-dominated reefs). Interestingly, the Sar- gassum-assay consumer assemblages differed between reef conditions; nominally grazing herbivores, Siganus puello- ides and Chlorurus sordidus, and the browser, Siganus sutor, dominated feeding on high coral cover reefs, whereas browsing herbivores, Naso elegans, Naso unicor- nis, and Leptoscarus vaigiensis, prevailed on macroalgal- dominated reefs. It appeared that macroalgal density in the surrounding habitat had a strong influence on the species driving the process of macroalgal removal. This suggests that although the function of macroalgal removal may continue, the species responsible may change with context, differing between systems that are regenerating versus degrading.},

Using transplanted Sargassum, the largest coral reef macroalga, we created habitat patches of predetermined macroalgal density (0.25-6.23 kg m(-2)). Remote video cameras revealed both grazing and browsing fishes avoided high density patches, preferring relatively open areas with low macroalgal cover.

For both corals and fishes, the unified model simultaneously captures extremely well local species-abundance distributions, interspecific variation in the strength of spatial aggregation, patterns of community similarity, species accumulation, and regional species richness, performing far better than alternative models also examined here and in previous work on coral reefs.

abstract = {Accumulative disturbances can erode a coral reef's resilience, often leading to replacement of scleractinian corals by macroalgae or other non-coral organisms. These degraded reef systems have been mostly described based on changes in the composition of the reef benthos, and there is little understanding of how such changes are influenced by, and in turn influence, other components of the reef ecosystem. This study investigated the spatial variation in benthic communities on fringing reefs around the inner Seychelles islands. Specifically, relationships between benthic composition and the underlying substrata, as well as the associated fish assemblages were assessed. High variability in benthic composition was found among reefs, with a gradient from high coral cover (up to 58{\%}) and high structural complexity to high macroalgae cover (up to 95{\%}) and low structural complexity at the extremes. This gradient was associated with declining species richness of fishes, reduced diversity of fish functional groups, and lower abundance of corallivorous fishes. There were no reciprocal increases in herbivorous fish abundances, and relationships with other fish functional groups and total fish abundance were weak. Reefs grouping at the extremes of complex coral habitats or low-complexity macroalgal habitats displayed markedly different fish communities, with only two species of benthic invertebrate feeding fishes in greater abundance in the macroalgal habitat. These results have negative implications for the continuation of many coral reef ecosystem processes and services if more reefs shift to extreme degraded conditions dominated by macroalgae.},

abstract = {The question at once arises, how is it that even the stoutest corals, resting with broad base upon the ground, and doubly secure from their spreading proportions, become so easily a prey to the action of the same sea which they met shortly before with such effectual resistance? The solution of this enigma is to be found in the mode of growth of the corals themselves. Living in communities, death begins first at the base or centre of the group, while the surface or tips still continue to grow, so that it resembles a dying centennial tree, rotten at the heart, but still apparently green and flourishing without, till the first heavy gale of wind snaps the hollow trunk, and betrays its decay. Again, innumerable boring animals establish themselves in the lifeless stem, piercing holes in all directions into its interior, like so many augurs, dissolving its solid connexion with the ground, and even penetrating far into the living portion of these compact communities. L. Agassiz (1852) Abstract Bioerosion, involving the weakening and breakdown of calcareous coral reef structures, is due to the chemical and mechanical activities of numerous and diverse biotic agents. These range in size from minute, primarily intra-skeletal organisms, the microborers (e.g., algae, fungi, bacteria) to larger and often externally-visible macroboring invertebrate (e.g., sponges, polychaete worms, sipunculans, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoids) and fish (e.g., parrotfishes, acanthurids, pufferfishes) species. Constructive coral reef growth and destruc-tive bioerosive processes are often in close balance. Dead corals are generally subject to higher rates of bioerosion than living corals, therefore, bioerosion and reef degradation can result from disturbances that cause coral mortality, such as sedimentation, eutrophication, pollution, temperature extremes, predation, and coral diseases. The effects of intensive coral reef bioerosion, involving El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation, Acanthaster predation, watershed alterations, and over-fishing, are re-examined after {\~{}}20 years (early 1990s–2010). We review the evidence showing that the biologically-mediated dissolution of calcium carbonate structures by endolithic algae and clionaid sponges will be accelerated with ocean acidification. The CaCO 3 budget dynamics of Caribbean and eastern tropical Pacific reefs is reviewed and provides sobering case studies on the current state of coral reefs and their future in a high-CO 2 world.},

While relationships among herbivory, algal cover, and coral recruitment, have been explored in the Caribbean, the nature of such relationships in the Pacific appears to be variable or unclear. Here, we examine potential drivers structuring the benthos and herbivorous fish assemblages of outer-shelf reefs in Micronesia (Palau, Guam and Pohnpei). Surveys were stratified by wave exposure and protection from fishing. High biomass of most herbivores was favoured by high wave exposure. High abundance of large-bodied scarids was associated with low turf abundance, high coral cover, and marine reserves. The remaining herbivores were more abundant in reefs with low coral cover, possibly because space and hence food limitation occur in high-coral-cover reefs. Rugosity had no detectable effect on herbivorous fish abundance once differences in exposure and coral cover were accounted for. At identical depths, high wave exposure was associated with greater volumes (cover 9 canopy height) of macroalgae and algal turfs, which most likely resulted from high primary productivity driven by flow. In exposed areas, macroalgal cover declined as the acanthurid biomass increased. The volume of algal turfs was negatively associated with coral cover and herbivore biomass. In turn, high coral cover and herbivore biomass are likely to intensify grazing. The density of juvenile corals was variable where macroalgal cover was low but was confined to lower densities where macroalgal cover was high. High coral cover and density of juvenile corals were favoured in sheltered habitats. While a weak positive relationship was found between scarid biomass and juvenile coral density, we hypothesise that high scarid densities may hinder juvenile density through increased corallivory. New hypotheses emerged that will help clarify the role of acanthurids, wave exposure, and corallivory in driving the recovery of Pacific coral communities.},

abstract = {Humans are an increasingly dominant driver of Earth's biological communities, but differentiating human impacts from natural drivers of ecosystem state is crucial. Herbivorous fish play a key role in maintaining coral dominance on coral reefs, and are widely affected by human activities, principally fishing. We assess the relative importance of human and biophysical (habitat and oceanographic) drivers on the biomass of five herbivorous functional groups among 33 islands in the central nd western Pacific Ocean. Human impacts were clear for some, but not all, herbivore groups. Biomass of browsers, large excavators, and of all herbivores combinded declined rapidly with increasing human population density, whereas grazers, scrapers, and detritivores displayed no relationship. Sea-surface temperature had significant but opposing efffects on the biomass of detritivores (positive) and browers (negative). Similarly, the biomass of scrapers, grazers, and detritivores correlated with habitat structural complexity; however, relationships were group specific. Finally, the biomass of browsers and large excavators was related to island geomorphology, both peaking on low-lying islands and atolls. The substantial variability in herbivore populations explained by natural biophysical drivers highlights the need for locally appropriate management targets on coral reefs.},

abstract = {1. While environmental filters are well-known factors influencing community assembly, the extent to which these modify species functions, and entire ecosystem processes, is poorly understood. 2. Focusing on a high-diversity system, we ask whether environmental filtering has ecosystem-wide effects beyond community assembly. We characterise a coral reef herbivorous fish community for swimming performance based on ten functional traits derived from fish morphology. We then investigate whether wave exposure modifies the functional make-up of herbivory, and the absolute and relative feeding frequency of distinct feeding functional groups. 3. Herbivorous fish species conformed to either laterally compressed or fusiform body plans, which differ in their morphological design to minimise drag. High wave exposure selectively limited the feeding function of the deepest body shapes with highest caudal thrust efficiency, and favoured fusiform bodies irrespective of pectoral fin shape. 4. Traditionally recognised herbivore feeding functional groups (i.e. grazers–detritivores and scrapers–small excavators) differed in swimming performance, and in their capacity to feed consistently across levels of wave exposure. We therefore emphasise the distinctness of their ecological niche and functional complementarity. 5. Species within the same feeding functional group also had contrasting responses to wave exposure. We thereby reveal a further ecological dimension of niche partitioning, and reiterate the risk of assuming functional redundancy among species with a common feeding mode. 6. Contrasting responses of species within feeding functional roles (i.e. response diversity) allowed the preservation of critical trophic functions throughout the gradient (e.g. macroalgal browsing), and likely explained why overall levels of herbivory were robust to filtering. Whether ecosystem functioning will remain robust under the additive effects of environmental stress and human-induced disturbances remains to be tested.},

abstract = {Patterns in the commonness and rarity of species are a fundamental characteristic of ecological assemblages; however, testing between alternative models for such patterns remains an important challenge. Conventional approaches to fitting or testing species abundance models often assume that species, not individuals, are the units that are sampled and that species' abundances are independent of one another. Here we test three different models (the Poisson lognormal, the negative binomial, and the neutral, "zero-sum multinomial" [ZSM]) against species abundance distributions of Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes. We derive and apply several alternative bootstrap analyses of model fit, each of which makes different assumptions about how species abundance data are sampled, and we assess the extent to which tests of model fit are sensitive to such assumptions. For all models, goodness of fit is remarkably consistent, regardless of whether one assumes that species or individuals are the units that are sampled or whether or not one assumes that species' abundances are statistically independent of one another. However, goodness-of-fit estimates are approximately twice as precise and detect lack of model fit more frequently, when based on sampling of individuals, rather than species. Bootstrap analyses indicate that the Poisson lognormal distribution exhibits substantially better fit to species abundance patterns, consistent with model selection analyses. In particular, heterogeneity in species abundances (many rare and few highly abundant species) is too great to be captured by the ZSM model or the negative binomial model and is best explained by models that predict species abundance patterns that are much closer, but not identical, to the lognormal distribution. More broadly, our bootstrap analyses suggest that estimates of model fit are likely to be robust to assumptions about the statistical interdependence of species abundances, but that tests of model fit are more powerful when they assume sampling of individuals, rather than species. Such individual-based tests therefore may be able to identify lack of model fit where previous tests have been inconclusive.},

abstract = {Herbivorous reef fish play an important role in shaping ecosystem processes on coral reefs. Often found in schools, Scarus rivulatus, is an abundant herbivorous species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, especially on inshore reefs. Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.},

abstract = {The reef fish assemblage at Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, was examined using visual censuses and the ichthyocide rotenone. Small 3.5 m2 quantitative rotenone samples, using a fine-mesh net to enclose the site, were compared with visual-point censuses (prior to the placement of the net), random-point censuses and strip censuses. Furthermore, the fishes collected inside and outside the net were examined to determine the relative efficiency of enclosed versus open rotenone samples. Rotenone samples comprised 128 species in 28 families. Of these, only 49{\%} of the species overlapped between the enclosed (inside net) and open (outside net) samples. Only 17.7{\%} of the species in the enclosed rotenone sample were seen prior to collection. Rotenone samples reveal that visual censuses underestimated the abundance of small taxa. Overall, rotenone samples increased the estimated number of species by 40.4{\%} and the total fish abundance by 50.1{\%} (75.3{\%} for fishes {\textless}50 mm). Biomass increased by less than 1.0{\%}. However, through relatively high energetic de- mands, high turnover rates and their role as potential prey, small fish taxa may play a greater role in reef processes than previously assumed. The limits of visual censusing techniques are highlighted, emphasising the value of small, enclosed, intensive rotenone samples for providing reliable quantitative samples of small taxa.},

We found a negative linear relationship between density and adult body size. This is in marked contrast to the polygonal relationship previously described for other local scale assemblage studies.

abstract = {1. Functional redundancy contributes to resilience if different species in the same functional group respond to disturbance in different ways (response diversity). If species in a functional group perform their functional role at different spatial scales (cross-scale redundancy), they are expected to respond differently to scale-specific disturbance. Consequently, variance in the spatial scales over which species perform their functional role may provide a proxy for resil- ience. 2. Coral reefs are diverse systems that provide key ecosystem services and are subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Algal grazing by herbivorous fish contributes to the maintenance of coral-dominated reefs. To date, there has been little evaluation of the traits driving response diversity among herbivorous fish and how this relates to coral recovery fol- lowing acute disturbances. 3. Using body size as a proxy for the spatial scale at which fish function, we tested whether cross-scale redundancy in herbivores was an effective indicator of response diversity and coral recovery on 21 reefs monitored through a climate-induced disturbance that caused coral bleaching and widespread coral mortality. 4. When herbivorous fish assemblages that operated over a broader range of spatial scales were present on reefs prior to disturbance, the reefs were more likely to recover to coral-dom- inated states after the disturbance. After the temperature-induced disturbance, the loss of small herbivores was compensated for through increases in large herbivores. This was indica- tive of high response diversity and drove the overall increase in herbivore biomass at recover- ing sites. These compensatory mechanisms were not found at sites where herbivores operated over a narrower range of spatial scales. 5. Synthesis and applications. Cross-scale redundancy provides managers with an indicator of coral reef resilience, although the contribution of cross-scale redundancy to resilience will vary among sites. Maintaining high cross-scale redundancy at a given site requires that no size classes of reef herbivores are disproportionately depleted by fishing. Balanced harvesting, where species are all fished in proportion to their potential production, would help achieve this.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge of a species' functional niche is crucial for the study of ecological communities and processes. The extent of niche overlap, functional redundancy and functional complementarity is of particular importance if we are to understand ecosystem processes and their vulnerability to disturbances. Coral reefs are among the most threatened marine systems, and anthropogenic activity is changing the functional composition of reefs. The loss of herbivorous fishes is particularly concerning as the removal of algae is crucial for the growth and survival of corals. Yet, the foraging patterns of the various herbivorous fish species are poorly understood. Using a multidimensional framework, we present novel individual-based analyses of species' realized functional niches, which we apply to a herbivorous coral reef fish community. In calculating niche volumes for 21 species, based on their microhabitat utilization patterns during foraging, and computing functional overlaps, we provide a measurement of functional redundancy or complementarity. Complementarity is the inverse of redundancy and is defined as less than 50{\%} overlap in niche volumes. The analyses reveal extensive complementarity with an average functional overlap of just 15{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}. Furthermore, the analyses divide herbivorous reef fishes into two broad groups. The first group (predominantly surgeonfishes and parrotfishes) comprises species feeding on exposed surfaces and predominantly open reef matrix or sandy substrata, resulting in small niche volumes and extensive complementarity. In contrast, the second group consists of species (predominantly rabbitfishes) that feed over a wider range of microhabitats, penetrating the reef matrix to exploit concealed surfaces of various substratum types. These species show high variation among individuals, leading to large niche volumes, more overlap and less complementarity. These results may have crucial consequences for our understanding of herbivorous processes on coral reefs, as algal removal appears to depend strongly on species-specific microhabitat utilization patterns of herbivores. Furthermore, the results emphasize the capacity of the individual-based analyses to reveal variation in the functional niches of species, even in high-diversity systems such as coral reefs, demonstrating its potential applicability to other high-diversity ecosystems.},

abstract = {The function of species has been recognized as critical for the maintenance of ecosystems within desired states. However, there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of interspecific differences in the functional roles of organisms, particularly with regard to the spatial scales over which functional impact is exerted. This has implications for the delivery of function and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. In this study we assessed the allometric relationship between foraging movements and fish body length at three sites, for 20 species of herbivorous reef fishes within four different functional groups: browsers, farmers, grazer/ detritivores, and scraper/excavators. The relationship between vulnerability of species to fishing and their scale of foraging was also examined. We present empirical evidence of the strong, positive, log-linear relationship between the scale of foraging movement and fish body length. This relationship was consistent among sites and between the two different movement metrics used. Phylogeny did not affect these results. Functional groups foraged over contrasting ranges of spatial scales; for example, scraper/excavators performed their role over a wide range of scales, whereas browsers were represented by few species and operated over a narrow range of scales. Overfishing is likely not only to remove species operating at large scales, but also to remove the browser group as a whole. Large fishes typically have a significant role in removing algae on reefs, and browsers are key to controlling macroalgae and reversing shifts to macroalgal-dominated states. This vulnerability to exploitation has serious consequences for the ability of fish assemblages to deliver their functional role in the face of anthropogenic impacts. However, identification of the scales at which herbivorous fish assemblages are susceptible to fishing provides managers with critical knowledge to design management strategies to support coral-dominated reefs by maintaining function at the spatial scales at which vulnerable species operate.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes shaping biological communities under multiple disturbances is a core challenge in ecology and conservation science. Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since the mass mortality of the urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983, parrotfishes have become the dominant grazer on Caribbean reefs. The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8{\%}. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.},

abstract = {Loss of coral reef resilience can lead to dramatic changes in benthic structure, often called regime shifts, which significantly alter ecosystem processes and functioning. In the face of global change and increasing direct human impacts, there is an urgent need to anticipate and prevent undesirable regime shifts and, conversely, to reverse shifts in already degraded reef systems. Such challenges require a better understanding of the human and natural drivers that support or undermine different reef regimes. The Hawaiian archipelago extends across a wide gradient of natural and anthropogenic conditions and provides us a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between multiple reef regimes, their dynamics and potential drivers. We applied a combination of exploratory ordination methods and inferential statistics to one of the most comprehensive coral reef datasets available in order to detect, visualize and define potential multiple ecosystem regimes. This study demonstrates the existence of three distinct reef regimes dominated by hard corals, turf algae or macroalgae. Results from boosted regression trees show nonlinear patterns among predictors that help to explain the occurrence of these regimes, and highlight herbivore biomass as the key driver in addition to effluent, latitude and depth.},

The hypothesis can be formulated that the floral electric field reinforces the effectiveness of other floral cues. If true, an electric cue paired with a color cue should produce an enhanced learning outcome equivalent to that obtained with the test using color and scent. Differential conditioning was used to test this hypothesis. The same two green target hues were used as in (23), but olfactory cues were replaced with a patterned electric field (Fig. 3C). Bees were trained to discriminate between E-flowers of hue 120° HSB (hue, saturation , brightness) which offered a sucrose reward, and E-flowers of hue 140° HSB, which provided an aversive quinine solution (Fig. 4A). Bees learned to discriminate between the rewarding and aversive chargeless E-flowers either using color information alone (n = 16) or in combination with the patterned E-field (n = 18) (Fig. 4A). When learning color on its own, discrimination to 80{\%} success (i.e., 8 out of the last 10 choices correct) took 35 T 3 visits. When combined with the E-field pattern, the number of visits required was significantly reduced to 24 T 3 (T 2-sample; unequal = 2.86, P = 0.008) (Fig. 4A). This demonstrates that the combination of two cues, E-field and hue, enhances the bee's ability to discriminate. Our results show that electric field constitutes a floral cue. Contributing to a varied floral display aimed at pollinator senses, electric fields act to improve both speed and accuracy with which bees learn and discriminate rewarding resources. As such, electric field sensing constitutes a potentially important sensory modality, which should be considered alongside vision and olfaction. The ubiquity of electric fields in nature and their integration into the bees' sensory ecology suggest that E-fields play a thus far unappreciated role in plant-insect interactions. The present study raises the possibility of reciprocal information transfer between plants and pollinators at time scales of milliseconds to seconds, much faster than previously described alterations in floral scent, color, or humidity (4, 18, 19). The remarkably accurate discrimination and learning of color patterns by bees was revealed by both laboratory and field training experiments (19, 21-23). Similarly , the present laboratory study reveals that floral electric fields occur in patterns and that they can be perceived. Hence, our study provides a framework for exploring the function and adaptive value of the perception of weak electric fields by bees in nature.},

abstract = {When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered against declines in functional diversity by the ability of the species-rich biota to display high functional redundancy: i.e., a high number of species performing similar functions. We tested this hypothesis using a ninefold richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316 species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out of 3,689) whereas 38{\%} of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that, even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought.},

Typically, research and management have focused on maintaining coral dominance and avoiding phase shifts to other species compositions, rather than on weakening the resilience of already degraded reefs to re-establish coral dominance. Reversing degraded coral-reef states will involve reducing local chronic drivers like fishing pressure and poor water quality. Reversals will also require management of key ecological processes – such as those performed by different functional groups of marine herbivores – that both weaken the resilience of the degraded state and strengthen the coral-dominated state.

abstract = {1. The application of network theory within the field of ecology has predominantly been based around the examination of species interactions (e.g. food webs). Extension of networks to spa- tial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support. 2. On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem function- ing. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well under- stood. 3. Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of mar- ine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12 months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community. 4. Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an ‘ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef. 5. Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to ana- lyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems. Key-words:},

Despite their similar morphology, the 2 species exhibited distinct feeding behaviours and significantly different feeding rates, diets and movements of digesta through the alimentary tract. S. doliatus displayed a typical herbivore diurnal feeding pattern, taking an average 9.7 bites min(-1) over the main part of the feeding day and with a diet dominated by red thallate algae (primarily Laurencia spp., Eucheuma sp., Halymenia sp, and Gracilaria sp,) and red and green filamentous algae.

abstract = {The world's coral reefs are in decline, with many exhibiting a phase shift from coral to macroalgal dominance [1-6]. This change is often associated with habitat loss and overharvesting of herbivorous fishes, particularly parrotfishes and surgeonfishes [6-9]. The challenge is to reverse this decline and enhance the resilience of coral-reef ecosystems [10, 11]. We demonstrate, by using a large-scale experimentally induced phase shift, that the rapid reversal from a macroalgal-dominated to a coral- and epilithic algal-dominated state was not a result of herbivory by parrotfishes or surgeonfishes. Surprisingly, phase-shift reversal was primarily driven by a single batfish species (Platax pinnatus), a fish previously regarded as an invertebrate feeder. The 43 herbivorous fishes in the local fauna played only a minor role, suggesting that biodiversity may not offer the protection we hoped for in complex ecosystems. Our findings highlight the dangers faced by coral reefs and other threatened complex ecosystems: Species or functional groups that prevent phase shifts may not be able to reverse phase shifts once they occur. Nevertheless, reversal is possible. The critical issue is to identify and protect those groups that underpin the resilience and regeneration of complex ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the marine realm, the tropics host an extraordinary diversity of taxa but the drivers underlying the global distribution of marine organisms are still under scrutiny and we still lack an accurate global predictive model. Using a spatial database for 6336 tropical reef fishes, we attempted to predict species richness according to geometric, biogeographical and environmental explanatory variables. In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential ‘mediation effects' among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80{\%} of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions. Our analysis revealed that a few easily accessible variables can accurately predict reef fish species richness. They also highlight concerns regarding ongoing environmental declines, with region-specific responses to variation in environmental conditions predicting a variable response to anthropogenic impacts.},

abstract = {Despite a large number of studies focusing on the complexity of coral reef habitats and the characteristics of associated fish assemblages, the relationship between reef structure and fish assemblages remains unclear. The textural discontinuity hypothesis, which proposes that multi-modal body size distributions of organisms are driven by discontinuous habitat structure, provides a theoretical basis that may explain the influence of habitat availability on associated organisms. In this study we use fractal techniques to characterize patterns of cross-scale habitat complexity, and examine how this relates to body-depth abundance distributions of associated fish assemblages over corresponding spatial scales. Our study demonstrates that: (1) Reefs formed from different underlying substrata exhibit distinct patterns of cross-scale habitat complexity; (2) The availability of potential refuges at different scales correlates with patterns in fish body depth distributions, but habitat structure is more strongly related to the relative abundance of fish in the body depth modes, rather than to the number of modes; (3) As reefs change from coral-to algal-dominated states, the complexity of the underlying reef substratum may change, presenting a more homogenous environment to associated assemblages; (4) Individual fish body depth distributions may be multi-modal, however, these distributions are not static characteristics of the fish assemblage and may change to uni-modal forms in response to changing habitat condition. In light of predicted anthropogenic changes, there is a clear need to improve our understanding of the scale of ecological relationships to anticipate future changes and vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss and fishing-induced changes in the size distributions of fishes can impact ecosystem function on coral reefs. These changes have led to an urgent need for studies on the particular roles of species to underpin effective coral reef management. The present study focuses on the feeding ecology of 6 size classes (from 2.5 to 30 cm total length) of Scarus rivulatus (family Labridae), one of the most abundant parrotfishes on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Individuals in all 6 size classes strongly selected the epilithic algal matrix for foraging and rejected other substratum types, including coral, macroalgae and sand. The 6 size classes also had similar feeding rates (bites min–1) and diel feeding patterns, with higher feeding activity during the afternoon. However, the size of grazing scars by S. rivualtus differed significantly among the 6 size classes, with small individuals scraping a greater substratum area per unit biomass and larger individuals taking a greater volume of material per unit biomass. Thus, biomass cannot be not be viewed as a proxy for ecosystem impact; different sized individuals of S. rivulatus, and probably other parrotfish species, have a markedly different impact on the reef substratum. Selective harvesting of large individuals will therefore change the functional role of this species. These results emphasize the importance of considering the size of individuals when evaluating the role of reef species in ecosystem process. These intraspecific functional differences will be critical when formulating reef management strategies and evaluating the impact of fishing activity on reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90{\%}. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50{\%} while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.},

the evolution and biogeography of faunas. However, quantitative
approaches are often limited at a global scale, particularly in
the marine realm. Reef fishes are the most diversified group of
marine fishes, and compared to most other phyla, their taxonomy
and geographical distributions are relatively well known. Based
on 169 checklists spread across all tropical oceans, the present
work aims to quantitatively delineate biogeographical entities
for reef fishes at a global scale. Four different
classifications were used to account for uncertainty related to
species identification and the quality of checklists. The four
classifications delivered converging results, with
biogeographical entities that can be hierarchically delineated
into realms, regions and provinces. All classifications
indicated that the Indo-Pacific has a weak internal structure,
with a high similarity from east to west. In contrast, the
Atlantic and the Eastern Tropical Pacific were more strongly
structured, which may be related to the higher levels of
endemism in these two realms. The ``Coral Triangle'', an area of
the Indo-Pacific which contains the highest species diversity
for reef fishes, was not clearly delineated by its species
composition. Our results show a global concordance with recent
works based upon endemism, environmental factors, expert
knowledge, or their combination. Our quantitative delineation of
biogeographical entities, however, tests the robustness of the
results and yields easily replicated patterns. The similarity
between our results and those from other phyla, such as corals,
suggests that our approach may be of broad utility in describing

abstract = {The removal of macroalgal biomass by fishes is a key process on coral reefs. Numerous studies have identified the fish species responsible for removing mature macroalgae, and have identified how this varies spatially, temporally, and among different algal types. None, how- ever, have considered the behavioural and morphological traits of the browsing fishes and how this may influence the removal of macroalgal material. Using video observations of fish feeding on the brown macroalga Sargassum poly- cystum, we quantified the feeding behaviour and mor- phology of the four dominant browsing species on the Great Barrier Reef (Kyphosus vaigiensis, Naso unicornis, Siganus canaliculatus, and Siganus doliatus). The greatest distinction between species was the algal material they targeted. K. vaigiensis and N. unicornis bit on the entire macroalgal thallus in approximately 90 {\%} of bites. In contrast, Si. canaliculatus and Si. doliatus avoided biting the stalks, with 80–98 {\%} of bites being on the macroalgal leaves only. This distinctive grouping into ‘entire thallus- biters' versus ‘leaf-biters' was not supported by size-stan- dardized measures of biting morphology. Rather, species-specific adult body sizes, tooth shape, and feeding beha- viour appear to underpin this functional distinction, with adults of the two larger fish species (N. unicornis and K. vaigiensis) eating the entire macroalgal thallus, while the two smaller species (Si. canaliculatus and Si. doliatus) bite only leaves. These findings caution against assumed homogeneity within this, and potentially other, functional groups on coral reefs. As functional redundancy within the macroalgal browsers is limited, the smaller ‘leaf-biting' species are unlikely to be able to compensate functionally for the loss of larger ‘entire thallus-biting' species.},

area. Despite considerable research into home-range allometry,
the relatively high variability in this relationship among taxa
means that the mechanisms driving this relationship are still
under debate. To date, studies have predominantly focused on
terrestrial taxa, and coral reef fishes in particular have
received little attention. We quantitatively reviewed studies
examining home range in reef fishes, and assessed the
interspecific relationship between body mass and home-range
area. Body mass and home range are positively related in reef
fishes (slopes of 1.15-1.72), with predators having larger home
ranges than herbivorous species. This may be attributed to the
mobility and lower abundance of predators' food items. Coral
reef fishes, and fishes in general, appear to occupy a smaller
area per unit mass than terrestrial vertebrates (intercepts of
-0.92 to 0.07 versus 1.14). This is likely linked to the
relative metabolic costs of moving through water compared to
air. The small home ranges of reef fishes and their apparent
reluctance to cross open areas suggest that reserves aimed at
protecting fish species may be more effective if located across
whole reefs, even if those reefs are comparatively small, rather
than if they cover subsections of contiguous reef, as home
ranges in the former are less likely to cross reserve

In the analyses, a clear morphological distinction was found between nocturnal and diurnal fishes. Nocturnal fishes had larger relative horizontal gapes and relative eye diameters by factors of 1.6 and 1.5, respectively. A bivariate plot separated into quadrants was used to assess the implications of morphological variation. The morphological measures reflected distinct ecological traits in each quadrant. Whilst nocturnal fishes had large relative gapes and eye diameters, diurnal predators and detritivores had the same wide gapes, but small relative eye diameters. Highly selective, visual feeders such as the Chaetodontidae and Pseudochromidae had large eyes and small gapes, whilst non-selective feeders with low visual dependence such as the grazing herbivores (Acanthuridae, Siganidae, etc.) had both small eye diameters and gape sizes.

responses in life history traits with increasing organism size.
Among these are the relationships between size and longevity,
mortality, growth rate, timing of maturity, and lifetime
reproductive output. Spanning three orders of magnitude in size,
coral reef fishes provide an ecologically diverse and
species-rich vertebrate assemblage in which to test these
generic responses. Here we examined these relationships by
quantifying the life cycles of three miniature species of coral
reef fish from the genus Eviota (Gobiidae) and compared their
life history characteristics with other reef fish species. We
found that all three species of Eviota have life spans of {\textless} 100
days, suffer high daily mortality rates of 7-8{\%}, exhibit rapid
linear growth, and matured at an earlier than expected size.
Although lifetime reproductive output was low, consistent with
their small body sizes, short generation times of 47-74 days
help overcome low individual fecundity and appear to be a
critical feature in maintaining Eviota populations. Comparisons
with other coral reef fish species showed that Eviota species
live on the evolutionary margins of life history possibilities
for vertebrate animals. This addition of demographic information
on these smallest size classes of coral reef fishes greatly

abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and
species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare
species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of
species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has
been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains
controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure
against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This
issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where
high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it
is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered
against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species
occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse
ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662
tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct
combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare
species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy.
Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are
likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other
species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than
expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63{\%}
and 98{\%} of fish species that are likely to support highly
vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and
regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32{\%} and 89{\%}
of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively.
Remarkably, 47{\%} of fish species and 55{\%} of tropical tree
species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions
have only one individual per sample on average. Our results
emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in
highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high
functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic,
cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately
increase the potential breadth of functions provided by
ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to
insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change
and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems.
Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role
of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {This study examined the changes in community composition of reef fishes by experimentally manipulating the availability of shelter provided by tabular structures on a mid-shelf reef on the Great Barrier Reef. At locations where access to tabular corals (Acropora hyacinthus and Acropora cytherea) was excluded, a rapid and sustained reduction in the abundance of large reef fishes occurred. At locations where tabular structure was added, the abundance and diversity of large reef fishes increased and the abundance of small reef fishes tended to decrease, although over a longer time frame. Based on their response to changes in the availability of tabular structures, nine families of large reef fishes were separated into three categories; designated as obligate, facultative or non-structure users. This relationship may relate to the particular ecological demands of each family, including avoidance of predation and ultraviolet radiation, access to feeding areas and reef navigation. This study highlights the importance of tabular corals for large reef fishes in shallow reef environments and provides a possible mechanism for local changes in the abundance of reef fishes following loss of structural complexity on coral reefs. Keystone structures have a distinct structure and disproportionate effect on their ecosystem relative to their abundance, as such the result of this study suggests tabular corals may constitute keystone structures on shallow coral reefs.},

abstract = {State indicators, e.g., mean size and trophic level of the fish assemblage, can provide important insights into the effects of fishing on ecosystems and the resource potential of the fishery. On coral reefs, few studies have examined the relative effects of fishing and other drivers, such as habitat, on these indicators. In light of habitat heterogeneity and increasing habitat degradation, this lack of understanding limits the usefulness of indicators for monitoring the effect of fishery management actions. Identifying thresholds or nonlinearities in relationships between fishing pressure and state indicators has been suggested as a basis for biomass-based targets to support management efforts in low research capacity contexts. Using data collected in Seychelles, we examined the relative influences of fishable biomass (proxy for fishing pressure) and the benthic habitat on fisheries-independent indicators characterizing attributes of the fish community important for fisheries production. We characterized the driver–indicator relationships, and compared local-scale relationships for Seychelles with large-scale relationships published for the Indian Ocean. We found that both habitat and fishing pressure influenced indicators, but habitat effects were particularly strong. This knowledge provides managers with the capacity to implement a diverse array of complementary management actions targeting these drivers. A number of the Seychelles scale driver–indicator relationships were linear, suggesting gradual changes in indicators in response to changes to drivers. This contrasted with relationships published for the Indian Ocean, which were characterized by thresholds below which exploitation is likely to have significant detrimental effects on the functioning of important ecosystem processes. These scale-specific differences are likely driven by the narrower range of fishing pressures found in Seychelles. Importantly, it indicates that, although biomass-based targets derived from large-scale relationships may provide a useful starting point for setting management targets, the local context must be considered.},

Three successively weakening interaction tiers separate management of fishing from coral abundance. We studied 12 islands along the 700-km eastern Caribbean archipelago, comparing fished and unfished coral reefs. Fishing reduced biomass of carnivorous (snappers and groupers) and herbivorous (parrotfish and surgeonfish) fishes. We document attenuating but important effects of managing fishing, which explained 37{\%} of variance in parrotfish abundance, 20{\%} of variance in harmful algal abundance, and 17{\%} of variance in juvenile coral abundance. The explained variance increased when we quantified herbivory using area-specific bite rates. Local fisheries management resulted in a 62{\%} increase in the archipelago's juvenile coral density, improving the ecosystem's recovery potential from major disturbances.},

We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment.

We conducted a series of field and mesocosm experiments to measure the relative effects of macroalgal identity and richness on primary productivity (net photosynthetic rate) and biomass accumulation in hard substratum subtidal communities in North Carolina, USA. Algal identity consistently and strongly affected production; species richness effects, although often significent, were subtle. Partitioning of the net biodiversity effect indicated that complementarity effects were always positive and species were usually more productive in mixtures than in monoculture. Surprisingly, slow growing species performed relatively better in the most diverse treatments than the most productive species, thus selection effects were consistently negative. Our results suggest that several basic mechanisms underlying terrestrial plant biodiversity effects also operate in algal-based marine ecosystems, and thus may be general.},

Predator-prey interactions provide an opportunity to examine the role of resource partitioning, thought to be a principal mediator of biodiversity-function relationships. To date, interactions between multiple predators and their prey have typically been investigated in simplified agricultural systems with limited scope for resource partitioning. Thus there remains a dearth of studies examining the functional consequences of predator richness in diverse food webs. Here, we manipulated a species-rich intertidal food web, crossing predator diversity with total predator density, to simultaneously examine the independent and interactive effects of diversity and density on the efficiency of secondary resource capture. The effect of predator diversity was only detectable at high predator densities where competitive interactions between individual predators were magnified; the rate of resource capture within the species mixture more than doubled that of the best-performing single species. Direct observation of species-specific resource use in monoculture, as quantified by patterns of prey consumption, provided clear evidence that species occupied distinct functional niches, suggesting a mechanistic explanation of the observed diversity effect.},

abstract = {The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to monocultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem function. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimensional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selection effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The functioning of ecosystems results from the interplay between living organisms and their surroundings. Therefore, our ability to predict ecosystem functioning depends on our understanding of interactions between dynamic biotic and abiotic variables. Biodiversity can be influenced by the changes in the environment and can also influence ecosystem functioning, but our understanding of how environmental changes influence biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships remains limited. In coastal marine systems, water flow is a crucial determinant of resource delivery for sessile suspension-feeding animals and can potentially influence secondary production and the rate at which suspended materials are removed from water, determining water clarity, light penetration, and other key abiotic variables. We experimentally investigated how the presence and absence of water flow influenced phytoplankton consumption by suspension-feeder communities of varying species richness and composition. Consumer species richness enhanced filtration to the same degree in both flow conditions, despite generally decreased filtration in flow and considerable variation in the response to flow by consumers in monoculture. Species pairs filtered more than expected from monoculture performance, and species traits helped explain variance in these trends. However, there was no evidence of prey size selectivity by any consumer species, ruling this out as a mechanism underlying diversity effects. Our finding that the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and water filtration was identical in both flow conditions suggests that complementarity in this system is robust to at least one type of environmental variation.},

abstract = {Reduced herbivory and enhanced nutrient concentrations have both been suggested as probable mechanisms driving phase shifts from coral to algal dominance on tropical reefs. While there is considerable information regarding the effects of herbivores on reefs, there is little experimental evidence of nutrient effects or the interactive effects of both of these factors. This study experimentally tested the role of these factors on benthic community structure on a coral-dominated reef in Hawaii. A randomized factorial block design was used to simultaneously investigate the effects of nutrient enrichment and herbivore exclusion on the development of benthic algal communities on artificial surfaces over a 6-month time period. Total algal biomass was greatest on settlement surfaces exposed to both nutrient enrichment and herbivore exclusion simultaneously. Fleshy algal biomass was greatest on surfaces removed from grazing whereas calcareous biomass was greatest on surfaces exposed to nutrient enrichment. Control surfaces exhibited consistently less total, fleshy and calcareous algal biomass than that on any of the experimental surfaces. Microinvertebrates were most abundant on surfaces within herbivore exclusion treatments but increased in number on all settlement surfaces over time. Sediment accumulation was positively correlated with fleshy algal biomass and was most abundant on surfaces within herbivore exclusion treatments; there was no pattern in sediment accumulation over time. This research demonstrates that on short time scales (less than 6 months), nutrient enrichment and herbivore exclusion can independently and interactively support shifts in benthic algal community structure on a Hawaiian reef.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

abstract = {Quantitative data are presented to assess the trophic role of scarids on the fringing coral reef of Bonaire (Netherlands Antilles), with particular emphasis on the stoplight parrotfish Sparisoma viride. Average herbivore biomass on the reef was 690 kg ha-1, 22{\%} of which was accounted for by S. viride. From data on relative gonad weights, daily spawning frequencies, and egg numbers obtained by stripping, with previous estimates of somatic growth and energy intake, a gross efficiency (GE: somatic plus gamete production/ consumption) of 2.3{\%} was obtained. This is a factor of five to seven lower than the GE suggested to be valid for most aquatic ecosystems, including coral reefs. To investigate one potential cause for our low estimate, overestimation of food intake, our intake estimates were compared with published values for other herbivorous coral reef fish. This yielded a relationship (daily C intake=0.0342 × W0.816; wet body mass W in g) with high correlation (r2=94.6{\%}, n=13), which shows that the intake estimates agree well with other published data. Averaged over the year, primary production at 0-3 m depth was 17.2 kg C ha-1day-1while herbivore consumption was estimated at 17.4 kg C ha-1day-1, indicating an ecotrophic efficiency (EE, the fraction of total production at one trophic level that is consumed by all predators) of 100{\%}. This suggests strongly that the food intake estimates are realistic, since no changes in algal biomass were observed over the study period. The two scarids for which food intake was actually measured in our own study area, were estimated to consume 55{\%} of the algal production in the shallow reef (S. viride, 20{\%}; Scarus vetula, 35{\%}). This is lower than expected if consumption were proportional to biomass (S. viride, 22{\%}; S. vetula, 40{\%} of herbivore biomass in the shallow reef). Consequently, a minimum estimate of 88-91{\%} can be inferred for the EE of these two species. Multiplied by GE, this yields a transfer efficiency (TE, the fraction of production passing from one trophic level to the next) of 2{\%}. For coastal and coral systems the primary production required (PPR) to sustain fisheries was estimated to be 8.3{\%}, which was based on a TE of 10{\%}. The present estimates show that the TE of a major herbivore at our reef is at least a factor of five lower. Assuming that the estimate is representative for all scarids (comprising 70{\%} of the herbivore standing stock), it can be concluded that the PPR to sustain coral reef fisheries may be as high as 40{\%} of the total primary production. The low value reported before, might suggest that the effect of fishing mainly affects target populations but not the lowest trophic levels. It is argued that our estimate is more realistic for coral reefs supporting high scarid biomass and explains better the many reports of coral destruction due to algal overgrowth at exploited reefs. {\textcopyright} 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most highly productive marine ecosystems, with a strong connection between herbivores and the production of benthic algae. The epilithic algal matrix (EAM) is a major source of primary production on coral reefs, and it is one of the dominant benthic microhabitats, covering up to 80{\%} of reef flats and back reefs and up to 70{\%} of reef slopes on outer-shelf sites of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Although herbivorous surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) are dominant members of most reef fish assemblages, there is a lack of quantitative information on their grazing impact, particularly those that feed upon the EAM in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of surgeonfish in maintaining algal turf biomass on coral reefs. Spatial patterns of EAM productivity, and herbivorous fish biomass and grazing intensity were quantified at different depths (deep vs. shallow) and exposures (windward vs. leeward) of reef slope environments of Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef. Surgeonfish were the numerically-dominant EAM grazing fish family, and to identify the daily impact of surgeonfish species on the EAM, data on their biomass (gm-2) and grazing intensity (total bitesm-2day-1) were combined with EAM productivity estimates (gCm-2day-1). EAM productivity was greatest in windward and shallow sites, and herbivorous fish biomass mirrored this pattern. Yet, there was no difference in the EAM standing crop or grazing intensity among habitats. In the most productive habitat (windward-shallow), grazer/detritivore surgeonfish species accounted for 74{\%} of the total herbivore biomass (gm-2), took 51{\%} of the total bites (m-2day-1), and removed an estimated 73{\%} of daily EAM productivity (gCm-2day-1). This study quantifies the role of surgeonfish in maintaining EAM biomass, and highlights their possible contribution to preventing shifts from coral- to algal-dominance following disturbance.},

abstract = {Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90{\%}. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50{\%} while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.},

abstract = {Global reductions in biodiversity and the accelerating loss and degradation of many of the world's ecosystems have intensi"ed research into the roles of species in ecosystem processes. Within coralreef systems, the parrot"shes (Labridae) are widely viewed as a key functional group in facilitating the recovery of reefs from recurrent disturbances. Although parrot"shes are commonly viewed as herbivores, exerting top- down control of algal communities, their unique jaws allow them to feed on almost all coral- reef substratum types. Consequently, parrot"sh are the primary agents responsible for a number of key ecological processes on coral reefs, namely, bioerosion, sediment production and transport, provision of space for coral settlement, and predation of live coral colonies. The parrot"shes, however, cannot be considered a uniform group.!Their functional roles are highly dependent on species feeding mode (scrapers, excavators, and browsers) and body size, with larger individuals having a disproportionately greater effect on the dynamics of benthic communities than smaller conspeci"cs. Parrot"sh are ubiquitous on tropical reefs worldwide, yet there is strong spatial structuring in the taxonomic and functional composition of the group. This spatial variation has been shaped by their biogeographic history, the productivity of their environment, and the habitat requirements of individual taxa. Over recent decades, increasing "shing pressure and habitat destruction have had a dramatic impact on the structure of parrot"sh assemblages, and as a consequence, on many reefs, normal ecosystem processes have been disrupted. Indeed, reef systems with severely depleted parrot"sh communities are less resilient to anthropogenic or natural environmental perturbations. Management strategies for the protection of this unique and critical functional group are urgently needed if we are to maintain the diversity, resilience, and structure of coral- reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {Coral reefs have emerged as one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to climate variation and change. While the contribution of a warming climate to the loss of live coral cover has been well documented across large spatial and temporal scales, the associated effects on fish have not. Here, we respond to recent and repeated calls to assess the importance of local management in conserving coral reefs in the context of global climate change. Such information is important, as coral reef fish assemblages are the most species dense vertebrate communities on earth, contributing critical ecosystem functions and providing crucial ecosystem services to human societies in tropical countries. Our assessment of the impacts of the 1998 mass bleaching event on coral cover, reef structural complexity, and reef associated fishes spans 7 countries, 66 sites and 26 degrees of latitude in the Indian Ocean. Using Bayesian meta-analysis we show that changes in the size structure, diversity and trophic composition of the reef fish community have followed coral declines. Although the ocean scale integrity of these coral reef ecosystems has been lost, it is positive to see the effects are spatially variable at multiple scales, with impacts and vulnerability affected by geography but not management regime. Existing no-take marine protected areas still support high biomass of fish, however they had no positive affect on the ecosystem response to large-scale disturbance. This suggests a need for future conservation and management efforts to identify and protect regional refugia, which should be integrated into existing management frameworks and combined with policies to improve system-wide resilience to climate variation and change.},

abstract = {Much research on coral reefs has documented differential declines in coral and associated organisms. In order to contextualise this general degradation, research on community composition is necessary in the context of varied disturbance histories and the biological processes and physical features thought to retard or promote recovery. We conducted a spatial assessment of coral reef communities across five reefs of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, with known disturbance histories, and assessed patterns of coral cover and community composition related to a range of other variables thought to be important for reef dynamics. Two of the reefs had not been extensively disturbed for at least 15 years prior to the surveys. Three of the reefs had been severely impacted by crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching approximately a decade before the surveys, from which only one of them was showing signs of recovery based on independent surveys. We incorporated wave exposure (sheltered and exposed) and reef zone (slope, crest and flat) into our design, providing a comprehensive assessment of the spatial patterns in community composition on these reefs. Categorising corals into life history groupings, we document major coral community differences in the unrecovered reefs, compared to the composition and covers found on the undisturbed reefs. The recovered reef, despite having similar coral cover, had a different community composition from the undisturbed reefs, which may indicate slow successional processes, or a different natural community dominance pattern due to hydrology and other oceanographic factors. The variables that best correlated with patterns in the coral community among sites included the density of juvenile corals, herbivore fish biomass, fish species richness and the cover of macroalgae. Given increasing impacts to the Great Barrier Reef, efforts to mitigate local stressors will be imperative to encouraging coral communities to persist into the future.},

abstract = {Humans are an increasingly dominant driver of Earth's biological communities, but differentiating human impacts from natural drivers of ecosystem state is crucial. Herbivorous fish play a key role in maintaining coral dominance on coral reefs, and are widely affected by human activities, principally fishing. We assess the relative importance of human and biophysical (habitat and oceanographic) drivers on the biomass of five herbivorous functional groups among 33 islands in the central nd western Pacific Ocean. Human impacts were clear for some, but not all, herbivore groups. Biomass of browsers, large excavators, and of all herbivores combinded declined rapidly with increasing human population density, whereas grazers, scrapers, and detritivores displayed no relationship. Sea-surface temperature had significant but opposing efffects on the biomass of detritivores (positive) and browers (negative). Similarly, the biomass of scrapers, grazers, and detritivores correlated with habitat structural complexity; however, relationships were group specific. Finally, the biomass of browsers and large excavators was related to island geomorphology, both peaking on low-lying islands and atolls. The substantial variability in herbivore populations explained by natural biophysical drivers highlights the need for locally appropriate management targets on coral reefs.},

abstract = {1. Functional redundancy contributes to resilience if different species in the same functional group respond to disturbance in different ways (response diversity). If species in a functional group perform their functional role at different spatial scales (cross-scale redundancy), they are expected to respond differently to scale-specific disturbance. Consequently, variance in the spatial scales over which species perform their functional role may provide a proxy for resil- ience. 2. Coral reefs are diverse systems that provide key ecosystem services and are subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Algal grazing by herbivorous fish contributes to the maintenance of coral-dominated reefs. To date, there has been little evaluation of the traits driving response diversity among herbivorous fish and how this relates to coral recovery fol- lowing acute disturbances. 3. Using body size as a proxy for the spatial scale at which fish function, we tested whether cross-scale redundancy in herbivores was an effective indicator of response diversity and coral recovery on 21 reefs monitored through a climate-induced disturbance that caused coral bleaching and widespread coral mortality. 4. When herbivorous fish assemblages that operated over a broader range of spatial scales were present on reefs prior to disturbance, the reefs were more likely to recover to coral-dom- inated states after the disturbance. After the temperature-induced disturbance, the loss of small herbivores was compensated for through increases in large herbivores. This was indica- tive of high response diversity and drove the overall increase in herbivore biomass at recover- ing sites. These compensatory mechanisms were not found at sites where herbivores operated over a narrower range of spatial scales. 5. Synthesis and applications. Cross-scale redundancy provides managers with an indicator of coral reef resilience, although the contribution of cross-scale redundancy to resilience will vary among sites. Maintaining high cross-scale redundancy at a given site requires that no size classes of reef herbivores are disproportionately depleted by fishing. Balanced harvesting, where species are all fished in proportion to their potential production, would help achieve this.},

abstract = {The function of species has been recognized as critical for the maintenance of ecosystems within desired states. However, there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of interspecific differences in the functional roles of organisms, particularly with regard to the spatial scales over which functional impact is exerted. This has implications for the delivery of function and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. In this study we assessed the allometric relationship between foraging movements and fish body length at three sites, for 20 species of herbivorous reef fishes within four different functional groups: browsers, farmers, grazer/ detritivores, and scraper/excavators. The relationship between vulnerability of species to fishing and their scale of foraging was also examined. We present empirical evidence of the strong, positive, log-linear relationship between the scale of foraging movement and fish body length. This relationship was consistent among sites and between the two different movement metrics used. Phylogeny did not affect these results. Functional groups foraged over contrasting ranges of spatial scales; for example, scraper/excavators performed their role over a wide range of scales, whereas browsers were represented by few species and operated over a narrow range of scales. Overfishing is likely not only to remove species operating at large scales, but also to remove the browser group as a whole. Large fishes typically have a significant role in removing algae on reefs, and browsers are key to controlling macroalgae and reversing shifts to macroalgal-dominated states. This vulnerability to exploitation has serious consequences for the ability of fish assemblages to deliver their functional role in the face of anthropogenic impacts. However, identification of the scales at which herbivorous fish assemblages are susceptible to fishing provides managers with critical knowledge to design management strategies to support coral-dominated reefs by maintaining function at the spatial scales at which vulnerable species operate.},

abstract = {The lined bristletooth, Ctenochaetus striatus, and the brown surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, are among the most abundant surgeonfishes on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Yet, the functional role of these species has been the focus of an ongoing debate lasting at least six decades. Specifically, to what extent are C. striatus herbivorous like the visually similar A. nigrofuscus? To address this question, we used natural feeding surfaces, covered with late successional stage reef-grown algal turfs, to examine turf algal removal by the two species. Surfaces exposed to C. striatus in laboratory experiments exhibited no significant reductions in turf length or area covered by turfing algae. In marked contrast, A. nigrofuscus reduced turf length by 51{\%} and area covered by turfing algae by 15{\%} in 1 h. The gut contents of specimens from the reef revealed that A. nigrofuscus predominantly ingests algae (the dominant item in 79.6–94.7{\%} of gut content quadrats), while C. striatus ingests detritus and sediments (dominant in 99.6–100{\%} of quadrats). Therefore, C. striatus ingests detritus and sediment, leaving mature algal turfs relatively intact, while A. nigrofuscus directly removes and ingests turf algae. The function of C. striatus differs from cropping herbivorous surgeonfishes such as A. nigrofuscus. On coral reefs, C. striatus brush detrital aggregates from algal turfs, removing microorganisms, organic detritus and inorganic sediment. Confusion over the functional role of C. striatus may stem from an inability to fit it into a single functional category.},

abstract = {1. While environmental filters are well-known factors influencing community assembly, the extent to which these modify species functions, and entire ecosystem processes, is poorly understood. 2. Focusing on a high-diversity system, we ask whether environmental filtering has ecosystem-wide effects beyond community assembly. We characterise a coral reef herbivorous fish community for swimming performance based on ten functional traits derived from fish morphology. We then investigate whether wave exposure modifies the functional make-up of herbivory, and the absolute and relative feeding frequency of distinct feeding functional groups. 3. Herbivorous fish species conformed to either laterally compressed or fusiform body plans, which differ in their morphological design to minimise drag. High wave exposure selectively limited the feeding function of the deepest body shapes with highest caudal thrust efficiency, and favoured fusiform bodies irrespective of pectoral fin shape. 4. Traditionally recognised herbivore feeding functional groups (i.e. grazers–detritivores and scrapers–small excavators) differed in swimming performance, and in their capacity to feed consistently across levels of wave exposure. We therefore emphasise the distinctness of their ecological niche and functional complementarity. 5. Species within the same feeding functional group also had contrasting responses to wave exposure. We thereby reveal a further ecological dimension of niche partitioning, and reiterate the risk of assuming functional redundancy among species with a common feeding mode. 6. Contrasting responses of species within feeding functional roles (i.e. response diversity) allowed the preservation of critical trophic functions throughout the gradient (e.g. macroalgal browsing), and likely explained why overall levels of herbivory were robust to filtering. Whether ecosystem functioning will remain robust under the additive effects of environmental stress and human-induced disturbances remains to be tested.},
