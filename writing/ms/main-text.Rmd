#### Introduction

*Species have certain functions. Lots of species comprise functional assemblages. Assemblage structure can vary naturally along gradients in habitat suitability, or because of anthropongeic activities that selectively remove individuals. Understanding shifts in function, particularly at small scales, is necessary for predicting changes in ecosystem function under increasing anthropogenic pressures.*

​	By exerting top-down control on algal organisms, herbivorous fishes perform key functions on coral reefs. Several decades of feeding observations indicate that herbivorous fishes are comprised of three main functional roles, defined by their feeding morphology and behaviours. Cropping species graze filamentous turf algae and promote coral settlement and growth by maintaining cropped algal states (REF), while scraping and excavating parrotfish clear dead coral substrate, consuming detritus and endolithial material (Russ et al. 2015). By controlling growth of algal organisms and promoting coral settlement, both cropping and scraping functions are critical processes that maintain coral-dominated reef states (Mumby, Burkepile). Browsers, the third feeding group, are macroalgal specialists which feed on fleshy algal taxa (Chong-Seng et al. 2015) and thus suppress macroalgal development, and can potentially revert macroalgal-dominated reefs to coral-dominated states (Bellwood et al. 2006). 

​	Combined, these three grazing functions are considered essential for the maintenance of coral-dominated states against background chronic stressors which cause coral and fish populations to decline (Bellwood et al. 2004, REF, REF). Small-scale herbivore exclusion experiments indicate that algae proliferate in the absence of grazers (Mumby, Burkepile), and correlative analyses of grazer biomass estimates have identified thresholds below which reefs become algal dominated (Graham et al. 2015, Jouffray et al. 2015, Robinson et al. 2018). In addition to fishing effects, herbivore assemblage structure can vary naturally according to differences in habitat types among reef zones (Hoey & Bellwood 2008) and reorganize over time to track changes in habitat composition (Gilmour et al. 2013). Such strong habitat effects have been linked to availability of habitat structure provided by corals (REF, Heenan et al. 2016), but also to increases in the availability of algal material and dead coral substrate following coral declines (Wilson et al. 2006, Gilmour et al. 2012, REF, REF). For browsing species, which tend to associate with macroalgal habitats (Wilson REF, Robinson et al. 2018), variation in grazing biomass has been linked to the density of established macroalgae (Hoey & Bellwood 20XX), as well as XYZ. Consequently, herbivore assemblage structure is mediated by benthic habitat composition and fishing intensity. 

​	Patterns in grazing biomass are widely used to imply changes in herbivore functioning (REF). However, the use of biomass as a proxy for function ignores size- and species-specific differences in grazing rates and behaviours (Steneck et al. 2018).  For example, because feeding rates scale allometrically with body size (Nash?), the functional role provided by larger individuals is disproportionately large (Bonaldo & Bellwood 2008). Because fishing often selects for larger individuals (REF) and certain species (REF), the composition and size structure of herbivore assemblage may vary along fishing gradients (REF, Robinson et al. 2017). Consequently, exploitation may cause both biomass reductions and species turnover, causing biomass and grazing function to become decoupled. As such, accounting for size- and species-differences in grazing rates can improve correlative models of grazing, benthic community composition, and fishing (Steneck et al. 2018). Indeed, studies that integrate biomass with information on feeding rates have demonstrated how fishing has severely degraded bioerosion rates in the Indo-Pacific (Bellwood et al. 2011). At smaller spatial scales, high sediment loads, XYZ have comprised feeding activity of croppers (REF) and XYZ for macroalgal consumption (REF). Quantifying changes in function requires XYZ, yet the direction and strength of biomass ~ function relationships under different habitat and fishing regimes has not yet been measured. 

​	Here, we combine underwater visual census (UVC) data with herbivore feeding observations to assess the relationship between herbivory, benthic habitat and fishing intensity. UVC data were collected at reefs in four Indo-Pacific regions, spanning a benthic gradient from coral to macroalgal dominance and a fishing gradient spanning X-Y fishable biomass. Surveyed reefs include habitats that experienced macroalgal regime shifts after climate-driven coral bleaching (Graham et al. 2015), and range in exploitation intensity from open-access fisheries to marine protected areas and near-pristine wilderness areas (Graham et al. REF). We fitted linear mixed effects models to examine variation in the biomass of three major functional feeding groups (grazers, scrapers, browsers) along benthic and fishing gradients. By converting grazer biomass to three grazing functions (turf grazing intensity, bioerosion, macroalgal consumption), and fitting the same predictive model structures, we assess potential decoupling of biomass from grazing function.

## Discussion points

Future reefs:

- benthic regimes likely non-coral dominated. What is herbivore function?
- fishing more important (^^ human population) and more reliant on low TLs. How does function shift ?

Caveats:

- benthic regimes. No information on turfs. These may be common regimes on bleached reefs (Goatley et al. (2016, Ecol Society)).

- importance of sediment (Tebbett et al. in press, check w/ Bellwood lab)

- functional differences within FGs leads to huge functional redundancy, espec. for browsers (Bellwood et al. 2009, Streit et al. 2015, Verges et al. 2015) (lots of herb ones?)

The effectiveness of browsers in removing established macroalgae is unclear (Suchley et al. 2016), particularly when macroalgae reaches high densities (Hoey & Bellwood 2011).

The use of grazer biomass as a proxy for grazing function ignores  (REF) particularly at large scales where the feeding observations required to convert biomass to functional rates are unavailable. 



Similarly, different species may perform different functional roles within the same group (Streit et al. 2015), while the degree of morphological, diet, and foraging specialization can vary significantly among related species (Bellwood et al. 2012 microniche paper, Brandl et al. 2015), to the extent that entire functions may be provided by a single species (Bellwood et al. 2006, Hoey & Bellwood 2009, Mouillot?). Such distinctions further confound the use of biomass as a proxy for function, in ways which we were unable to measure here.
