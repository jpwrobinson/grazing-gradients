#### Introduction

*Species have certain functions. Lots of species comprise functional assemblages. Assemblage structure can vary naturally along gradients in habitat suitability, or because of anthropongeic activities that selectively remove individuals. Understanding shifts in function, particularly at small scales, is necessary for predicting changes in ecosystem function under increasing anthropogenic pressures.*

​	By exerting top-down control on algal organisms, herbivorous fishes perform key functions on coral reefs. Several decades of feeding observations indicate that herbivorous fishes are comprised of three main functional roles, defined by their feeding morphology and behaviours (Bellwood & Choat 1990, Polunin 1995, Green & Bellwood 2009). Cropping species graze filamentous turf algae and promote coral settlement and growth by maintaining cropped algal states, leaving coral substrate intact (REF). Scraping parrotfish graze dead coral substrate to consume detritus and endolithial material, with larger species further defined as excavators which target live coral and remove larger portions of hard substrate (Bonaldo et al. 2014, Russ et al. 2015). By controlling growth of algal organisms and promoting coral settlement, both cropping and scraping functions are critical processes that maintain coral-dominated reef states (Mumby, Burkepile). Browsing species are macroalgal specialists and so are less directly linked to coral dominance. Browsers feed on established fleshy algal taxa (Chong-Seng et al. 2015) and can thus suppress macroalgal development, and can potentially revert macroalgal-dominated reefs to coral-dominated states (Bellwood et al. 2006). 

​	Combined, these three grazing functions are considered essential for the maintenance of coral-dominated states against background chronic stressors which cause coral and fish populations to decline (Bellwood et al. 2004, REF, REF). Small-scale herbivore exclusion experiments indicate that algae proliferate in the absence of grazers (Mumby, Burkepile) have been scaled up to identify grazing biomass thresholds below which reefs become algal dominated (Graham et al. 2015, Jouffray et al. 2015, Robinson et al. 2018). Herbivore populations are overexploited across the tropics (Edwards et al. 2014), implying that grazing functions are comprimised on most inhabited reefs. However, herbivore assemblages also exhibit strong spatial structuring, whereby strong habitat associations can cause biomass distributions to vary among neigbouring habitat types (Doropoulus et al. 2013, ). Temporal changes to benthic composition, such as coral declines following physical disturbances, can thus cause herbivore populations to reorganize over time (Gilmour et al. 2013, Russ et al. 2015). Habitat effects have been linked to availability of coral architecture (REF, Heenan et al. 2016), but also to the availability of algal material and dead coral substrate (Wilson et al. 2006, Gilmour et al. 2013, REF, REF). For browsing species, which tend to associate with macroalgal habitats (Wilson REF, Robinson et al. 2018), variation in grazing biomass has been linked to the density of established macroalgae (Hoey & Bellwood 20XX), as well as XYZ (Hoey et al. 2013). Consequently, herbivore assemblage structure is mediated by benthic habitat composition and fishing intensity. 

​	Patterns in grazing biomass are widely used to imply changes in herbivore functioning (REF). However, the use of biomass as a proxy for function ignores size- and species-specific differences in grazing rates and behaviours (Steneck et al. 2018).  Feeding rates scale allometrically with body size (Lokrant et al. 2008, Nash et al. 2013) such that the functional role provided by larger individuals is disproportionately large (Bonaldo & Bellwood 2008). Size-selective fishing removes larger individuals and species from herbivore assemblages, leading to shifts in composition (REF) and size structure (Robinson et al. 2017). By integrating biomass estimates with information on feeding rates, studies have demonstrated how fishing has severely degraded bioerosion rates in the Indo-Pacific (Bellwood et al. 2003, 2011). At smaller spatial scales, natural changes in assemblage structure correspond with variation in grazing activity among reef zones (Hoey et al. 2008) and along depth gradients (Fox & Bellwood 2008), while high sediment loads can suppress feeding activity (Goatley & Bellwood 2012, Goatley et al. 2016). Similarly, when herbivore assemblages reorganize in response to XYZ, grazing function is altered (Kelly et al. 2017). Thus, biomass ~ function relationships will become decoupled as the herbivore assemblage composition and size structure respond to habitat changes and fishing effects. Despite evidence that accounting for size- and species-differences in grazing rates can improve correlative models of grazing, benthic community composition, and fishing (Mumby 2006, Steneck et al. 2018), the direction and strength of biomass ~ function relationships under different habitat and fishing regimes remain unmeasured. 

​	Here, we combine underwater visual census (UVC) data with herbivore feeding observations to assess the relationship between herbivory, benthic habitat and fishing intensity. UVC data were collected at reefs in four Indo-Pacific regions, spanning a benthic gradient from coral to macroalgal dominance and a fishing gradient spanning X-Y fishable biomass. Surveyed reefs include habitats that experienced macroalgal regime shifts after climate-driven coral bleaching (Graham et al. 2015), and range in exploitation intensity from open-access fisheries to marine protected areas and near-pristine wilderness areas (Graham et al. REF). We fitted linear mixed effects models to examine variation in the biomass of three major functional feeding groups (grazers, scrapers, browsers) along benthic and fishing gradients. By converting grazer biomass to three grazing functions (turf grazing intensity, bioerosion, macroalgal consumption), and fitting the same predictive model structures, we assess potential decoupling of biomass from grazing function.

## Discussion points

Future reefs:

- benthic regimes likely non-coral dominated. What is herbivore function?
- fishing more important (^^ human population) and more reliant on low TLs. How does function shift ?

Caveats:

- benthic regimes. No information on turfs. These may be common regimes on bleached reefs (Goatley et al. (2016, Ecol Society)).

- importance of sediment (Tebbett et al. in press, check w/ Bellwood lab)

- functional differences within FGs leads to huge functional redundancy, espec. for browsers (Bellwood et al. 2009, Streit et al. 2015, Verges et al. 2015) (lots of herb ones?)

The effectiveness of browsers in removing established macroalgae is unclear (Suchley et al. 2016), particularly when macroalgae reaches high densities (Hoey & Bellwood 2011).

The use of grazer biomass as a proxy for grazing function ignores  (REF) particularly at large scales where the feeding observations required to convert biomass to functional rates are unavailable. 



Similarly, different species may perform different functional roles within the same group (Streit et al. 2015), while the degree of morphological, diet, and foraging specialization can vary significantly among related species (Bellwood et al. 2012 microniche paper, Brandl et al. 2015), to the extent that entire functions may be provided by a single species (Bellwood et al. 2006, Hoey & Bellwood 2009, Mouillot?). Such distinctions further confound the use of biomass as a proxy for function, in ways which we were unable to measure here.
