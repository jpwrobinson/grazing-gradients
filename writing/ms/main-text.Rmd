#### Intro banger - measuring multifunctionality

Species have certain functions, often comprising functional assemblages. These are influence by both natural and human drivers. Understanding shifts in function, particularly at small scales, is necessary for predicting changes in ecosystem function under increasing anthropogenic pressures.

#### Reefs as model system: grazing functions

Herbivores perform key functions on coral reefs. 'Cropper' species graze filamentous turf algae and promote coral settlement and growth by maintaining cropped algal states (REF). Scraping and excavating parrotfish clear dead coral substrate, consuming detritus and endolithial material (Russ et al. 2015) which promotes coral settlement and recruitment (REF). Evidence that cropping and scraping functions promote coral-dominated states largely stem from observations that algal organisms proliferate in the absence of grazers, in both small-scale experiments (Mumby, Burkepile) and large-scale correlational patterns spanning entire reef regions (Jouffray et al. 2015, Robinson et al. 2018). Browsing species are macroalgal specialists which, by feeding on fleshy algal taxa (Chong-Seng et al. 2015, REF) suppress macroalgal development and can potentially revert macroalgal-dominated reefs to coral-dominated states (Bellwood et al. 2006). The effectiveness of browsers in removing established macroalgae is unclear (Suchley et al. 2016), particularly when macroalgae reaches high densities (Hoey & Bellwood 2011).

#### Biomass as a proxy for function: 1) bottom-up, top-down effects on biomass

Combined, these three grazing functions are considered essential for the maintenance of coral-dominated states, particularly on reefs where anthropogenic activities are chronic stressors on coral and fish populations (Bellwood et al. 2004, REF, REF). Yet herbivore assemblage structure can vary naturally among reef zones (REF) and reorganize following changes in habitat composition (REF), while fishing activity can remove substantial biomass (REF). For example, coral-dominated reefs with 3-D habitat structure typically support high cropper and scraper biomass (REF, Heenan et al. 2016), but herbivore populations can also increase after coral declines, likely due to greater availability of algal material and dead coral substrate (Wilson et al. 2006, Gilmour et al. 2012, REF, REF). As macroalgal feeders, browsing species tend to associate with macroalgal habitats (Wilson REF, Robinson et al. 2018) and thus browser biomass is expected to..... Consequently, in addition to their top-down control of algal communities, herbivores are mediated by the availability of benthic habitat.

Furthermore, fishing can supersede habitat effects as the primary driver of herbivore biomass and functioning. On inhabited reefs, exploitation has reduced grazing biomass across the tropics (Edwards et al. 2014), which has been linked to a loss of grazer feeding potential (REF), bioerosion (Bellwood et al. 2011), and macroalgal consumption (REF). 

#### Biomass as a proxy for function: 2) we expect decoupling of biomass and function

 In lieu of in situ feeding observations, grazer biomass is typically used a proxy for grazing function (REF). Yet the use of biomass as a proxy for function ignores size- and species-specific differences in grazing rates and behaviours (Steneck et al. 2018).  For example, because feeding rates scale allometrically with body size (Nash?), the functional role provided by larger individuals is disproportionately large (Bonaldo & Bellwood 2008). Similarly, different species may perform different functional roles within the same group (Streit et al. 2015), while the degree of morphological, diet, and foraging specialization can vary significantly among related species (Bellwood et al. 2012 microniche paper, Brandl et al. 2015), to the extent that entire functions may be provided by a single species (Bellwood et al. 2006, Hoey & Bellwood 2009, Mouillot?). Such distinctions may confound the use of biomass as a proxy for function. Because fishing often selects for larger individuals (REF) and certain species (REF), the composition and size structure of herbivore assemblage may vary along fishing gradients (REF, Robinson et al. 2017). Consequently, exploitation may cause both biomass reductions and species turnover, causing biomass and grazing function to become decoupled. As such, accounting for size- and species-differences in grazing rates can improve correlative models of grazing and benthic community composition (Steneck et al. 2018), but the direction and strength of biomass ~ function relationships under different habitat and fishing regimes has not yet been measured. 

#### Here we do this with that to show something

Here, we combine underwater visual censuses with herbivore feeding observations to assess the relationship between herbivory, benthic habitat and fishing intensity. Data were collected at reefs in four Indo-Pacific regions, spanning a benthic gradient from coral to macroalgal dominance and a fishing gradient spanning X-Y fishable biomass. Surveyed reefs include habitats that experienced macroalgal regime shifts after climate-driven coral bleaching (Graham et al. 2015), and range in exploitation intensity from open-access fisheries to marine protected areas and near-pristine wilderness areas (Graham et al. REF). We fitted linear mixed effects models to examine variation in the biomass of three major functional feeding groups (grazers, scrapers, browsers) along benthic and fishing gradients. By converting grazer biomass to three grazing functions (turf grazing intensity, bioerosion, macroalgal consumption), and fitting the same predictive model structures, we assess potential decoupling of biomass from grazing function.

## Discussion points

***

Future reefs:

- benthic regimes likely non-coral dominated. What is herbivore function?
- fishing more important (^^ human population)Â and more reliant on low TLs. How does function shift ?

Caveats:

- benthic regimes. No information on turfs. These may be common regimes on bleached reefs (Goatley et al. (2016, Ecol Society)).

- importance of sediment (Tebbett et al. in press, check w/ Bellwood lab)

- functional differences within FGs (Streit et al. 2015, lots of herb ones)
